00c3e9df-0d9d-4dc6-b98b-f88dfae8d81e  — Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal left a game Saturday night against the Indiana Pacers midway through the third quarter with a sprained pelvis and is doubtful to return.

Beal scored 12 points before taking a nasty fall on a layup attempt with 6:17 remaining in the period.

After taking Ian Mahinmi's foul, Beal continued driving. He lost his balance during Myles Turner's block attempt and crashed hard to the ground on his right hip. He had to be helped off the court.

Beal missed 16 games in December and January with a right leg stress reaction. He entered Saturday averaging 18.0 points in 40 games.
ecdf95ec-4879-4efd-9c59-4bfe743ea806  — New Orleans guard Eric Gordon again broke his right ring finger during Saturday night's game against the Utah Jazz, a 106-94 loss.

Gordon left the game in the first half after a collision with Jazz center Rudy Gobert. He headed toward the locker room and did not return with the team when the second half began. The Pelicans announced his latest diagnosis during the third quarter.

"He worked so hard to get back and I really thought he was playing good basketball," Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said after the game of Gordon, who had averaged nearly 23 points in his first three games back from the initial injury. "So for that to happen to him again ... that's really unfortunate."

Gordon missed 16 games with a fractured right ring finger before returning Feb. 27. He provided an instant scoring boost, averaging nearly 23 points during his first three games back in the lineup. He has averaged about 15.4 points this season.
1d725fcb-ec9c-4477-87c5-2229925b4310  — Bulls star Jimmy Butler is in the starting lineup against Houston after missing the previous 11 games because of a strained left knee.

The two-time All-Star had been out since he scored 19 points in a loss at Denver on Feb. 5.

Taj Gibson also is starting after missing a game because of a hamstring problem, and Nikola Mirotic is available for the first time since Jan.25. He missed 16 games following an appendectomy and subsequent procedure to remove a blood clot.

With Butler, Gibson and Mirotic back, the Bulls had all their top players available except Joakim Noah, who is expected to miss the remainder of the season after having left shoulder surgery in January. Chicago had dropped four in a row before Saturday's game.
75b1f2e3-4bce-439e-86fa-dc1397c840c6  — New Orleans Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry says 7-foot center Omer Asik is returning from a right ankle sprain and is starting Saturday night's game against the Utah Jazz.

Asik has missed five full games since his injury against Detroit on Feb. 21. His return comes two days after the Pelicans learned that 7-2 center Alexis Ajinca will be sidelined indefinitely with a fractured sternum.

The 29-year-old Asik has dealt with nagging lower leg injuries this season, missing 12 games. He has averaged 3.8 points and 6.2 rebounds.

He returns as the Pelicans cling to the remote hope of climbing into playoff contention during their final 22 regular season games.

New Orleans entered Saturday's action 6 1/2 games behind Houston for the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference.
9fb1a267-bd4d-4c29-a1f3-5959a2c1ac64  — Rookie Kristaps Porzingis is sitting out the Knicks' game against Detroit because of a bruised lower left leg.

The Knicks made the announcement a little less than an hour before the start of Saturday's game. Porzingis walked by slowly with the team doctor a few minutes later, saying he was all right.

The No. 4 pick in the draft is the Knicks' second-leading scorer with 14 points per game. This was just the second game he missed this season.

He played 20 minutes Friday in a loss to Boston, finishing with 15 points.
eab5bdb2-547f-454e-ae21-5733df4da94c  — Los Angeles Lakers rookie Anthony Brown will be out for at least four weeks with a stress reaction in his right foot.

The Lakers announced the results of Brown's MRI exam on Saturday.

He is averaging 4.0 points and 2.4 rebounds in 29 games for the Lakers this season. The second-round pick has started 11 games.

He played sparingly in the first two months of the season before cracking the rotation in January. He was in only two games in February, but played at least 26 minutes in the Lakers' last four games.

Lou Williams also is out for Sunday's game against Golden State with a strained hamstring.

Kobe Bryant might sit out again with a sore right shoulder, and Jordan Clarkson could miss another game with a patellar strain.
42f3c183-261e-4ee3-bd96-cf3c3da4aebf  — Chris Bosh offered a slight update Saturday on his health, his first public hint of how he's doing since withdrawing from the NBA All-Star Game three weeks ago.

"Feeling good! Feeling great!" Bosh wrote on Twitter, along with a separate mention that he worked out Saturday. He also posted a blog about things he wished he knew in his 20s, but made no reference to his health status there.

Bosh was ruled out of the All-Star Game with what was described as a calf strain. A person with knowledge of the situation later told The Associated Press that a blood clot was found in Bosh's calf, and that he was back on blood-thinning medication - just as he was last year when his season ended at the All-Star break.

Neither the team nor Bosh has confirmed the second clot, although this situation clearly is not as severe as what he faced last year. At that time, he was hospitalized for several days after a clot worked its way to one of his lungs.

Athletes on blood thinners typically are prohibited from contact sports, given the higher risk of bleeding. It's unclear if Bosh is still on blood-thinning medication.

He will not play Sunday when Miami, a winner of four straight games, hosts the Philadelphia 76ers. Bosh has been around the team at times since the All-Star break, even doing some shooting on occasion, according to teammates.

Heat President Pat Riley said late last month he believes Bosh is trying to find a way back to the court this season, but did not elaborate.

Miami is 7-2 since Bosh was sidelined. Bosh is averaging 19.1 points this season, his 13th in the NBA and his second year in a five-year, $118 million contract.
2ee9d06d-5a57-4ad4-8966-4d111b18226f  — The Phoenix Suns today waived guard/forward Sonny Weems.

Weems, in his fourth NBA season, appeared in 36 games with the Suns, averaging 2.5 points, 1.3 assists and 1.1 rebounds in 11.7 minutes. He originally was signed by the Suns last July.

The Suns' roster now stands at 13 players.
c6579a17-7d65-443f-87c0-8e13bb0c256f  — The Indiana Pacers have put forward Chase Budinger on waivers.

The 6-foot-7 Budinger played in 49 games for Indiana, averaging 4.4 points and 2.5 rebounds after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last July.

The move Saturday could clear the way for the Pacers to add point guard Ty Lawson. Several media outlets reported earlier this week that Lawson has agreed to a deal with the Pacers, citing sources they did not identify. The team has not confirmed the deal and Lawson's agent did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Indiana plays at Washington on Saturday night.
3a01b85d-cf65-490e-8838-597dc4eeebcd  — The Thunder have signed free-agent center Nazr Mohammed.

The team made the announcement on Saturday, and terms were not disclosed.

The 38-year-old Mohammed spent two seasons with the Thunder (2010-12), appearing mostly as a reserve in 87 games and averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds in 12.9 minutes. He was a part of the Oklahoma City team that reached the NBA Finals in 2012.

The 17-year veteran owns career averages of 5.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 1,000 games with seven other teams.
a19677ca-abb4-4744-b835-31696d3527cf  Much like our Kia MVP Ladder, the OSPR is looking more and more like a one-horse race.

That's bound to happen when you're a 7-footer putting up numbers usually reserved for elite shooting guards and small forwards.

No one may be bumping the king from his mountain, but there's still some movement right under him, including a familiar name finally making the ascension into the top three. As for the bottom half of the list, we'll play nice and just say 'no comment.'

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 3. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 4 games, 16.3 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 6.0 apg

Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 3.8 apg

As was the case in Week 14, one look at last week's numbers and you see why Gasol is widening his lead on the field. Yes, he shot just 40.6 from the field and has gone consecutive games with fewer than 10 rebounds after three straight with 15 or more, but how can you not be impressed with Saturday's triple-double: 22 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists. For good measure, Gasol added three blocks.

Gasol's Triple-Double Pau Gasol notches a triple-double scoring 22 points with 16 boards and 14 dimes versus Portland.

2. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 4 games, 22.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 5.8 apg

Season stats: 19.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg

It was another solid week for Wade, who has now secured seven or more assists in three of the last five games and 18 or more points in five straight. It looks like adding Joe Johnson to the lineup hasn't disrupted the offense -- or Wade's game. It might be an even more productive week coming up, as Wade faces the 76ers twice, the Bucks and the Bulls.

Heat vs. Knicks Dwyane Wade scores 26 points with 7 rebounds as the Heat beat the Knicks 98-81 on Sunday night.

3. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: 4 games, 18.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.5 apg

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.7 apg

It wasn't a spectacular week for Randolph, but it was good enough to be just the third player to disrupt the Big Three of Gasol, Wade and Nowitzki (Jamal Crawford in Week 13 and Tony Parker in Week 2). Despite a dip in rebounding, the scoring remained consistent, managing 19 or more in three of four. For good measure, Randolph went 20-for-20 from the free-throw line.

4. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.7 ppg, 1.3 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 14.0 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.1 apg

It's quite amazing what Crawford can do offensively when you factor in his playing time. Last week, Crawford averaged just under 20 points while playing 27.8 minutes per game. That translates to a whopping 33.9 points per 48 minutes. If given 30 minutes per game (he's averaging 26.6 this season), would Crawford average 20 points?

Nets vs. Clippers Jamal Crawford heats up for 26 points off the bench as the Clippers beat the Nets 105-95 on Monday night.

5. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 4 games, 16.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 17.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.7 apg

Is it slip-slidding-away time for Nowitzki? After all, this is his lowest standing on the OSPR all season. It's not as though he played terribly, just the other two played better. We expect the big German to rebound quickly, but he'll need to put together a string of solid games in order to jump over Randolph and/or Crawford.

6. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 8

Last week's stats: 17.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 11.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 4.0 apg

This is the spot on the list where things get a bit ugly since no one did anything to warrant moving up, which of course means Johnson makes the climb by default. He seems to have taken nicely to his new surroundings in Miami, shooting 60 percent from the field and 62.5 from beyond the arc. Equally nice is the fact the Heat are a perfect 3-0 with Johnson.

Johnson's First Points With Heat Joe Johnson finds the bottom of the net for his first points with the Miami Heat.

7. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 3 games, 9.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.1 apg

After his big leap in Week 14, Parker slipped a bit. He shot 50 percent from the field, but Thursday's two-point performance against the Pelicans put an end to a string of seven straight games with double-figure scoring. He's also gone three straight with less than six assists.

8. Matt Barnes (35), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 9

Last week's stats: 4 games, 8.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 9.0 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 1.9 apg

Two good games, two bad ones. We've seen this before from Barnes, who shot just 36.4 from the field and 17.6 (3-for-17) from beyond the arc. In his two bad outings, Barnes combined for two points on 1-for-11 shooting. In two good showings, he managed to average 16.0 points and 5.5 rebounds on 11-for-22 shooting.

9. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 1 game, 5.0 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 4.1 apg, 3.2 apg

Bryant, who has been limited because of recurring soreness in his right shoulder, played just 11 minutes last week and goes into this week questionable. Maybe that shoulder is still recovering from that two-game stretch in which he put up 45 shots. Injury or not, another week like this and Bryant will be bumped from the list.

10. Mike Dunleavy (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.3 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 8.5 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.4 apg

We realize last week's stats leave a lot to be desired, but there weren't any better choices out there. Trust us. Dunleavy, who is seeing a steady amount of minutes (25.9 last week), shot 41.2 (7-for-17) from beyond the arc, connecting on two or more 3s in three of four games and has now nailed at least one trey in eight straight.

Just missed the cut: Amar'e Stoudemire, Jason Terry, Vince Carter

bfaaae58-88df-424f-b6cf-929fdaa9210b  — DeMar DeRozan set an NBA record by making 24 straight free throws on his way to a season-high 38 points and the Toronto Raptors overcame a huge game from Damian Lillard to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 117-115 on Friday night for their franchise-record 12th straight home win.

Lillard scored 50 points, one shy of his career high set last month in a 137-105 win over Golden State.

DeRozan went 24 for 25 from the free-throw line, both career highs.

A 3-pointer from Lillard, his sixth of the night, made the last 2.2 seconds uncomfortable for the Raptors, but DeRozan was sent to the free-throw line once again, registering his only miss of the night, to close out the game.

DeRozan started at small forward instead of shooting guard for the first time this season to accommodate Nick Powell.
a0243e9e-3e4f-4290-bc2f-ecfa7a0f5690  — The San Antonio Spurs are adding some more offensive firepower to try to keep up with Golden State.

The Spurs are landing veteran free agent Kevin Martin, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Friday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been officially announced.

Martin reached a buyout with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday and was eager to join a playoff contender. He made the decision to choose the Spurs and bring his perimeter shooting and scoring ability to one of the best teams in the league.

The 33-year-old Martin has forged a reputation as one of the most reliable perimeter scorers of his era. He struggled with a wrist injury early this season and never got on the same page with Timberwolves interim coach Sam Mitchell's system, two elements that conspired for his 10.6 points per game average and 37.7 percent shooting. Those numbers are far below his career averages, of 17.6 points and 43.8 percent shooting.

Martin is following fellow Timberwolves teammate Andre Miller, who was bought out two weeks ago, in coming to San Antonio. After Miller signed with the Spurs, he said the first Timberwolves player he heard from was Martin offering his congratulations.

Now, Martin moves from a team built around young talent and playing for the future to a team with the longest-running continuity in the league that is gunning for the sixth championship in franchise history.

The Spurs are off to the best start in their proud history, but their staggering 52-9 record is good for only second place in the Western Conference thanks to defending champion Golden State's historic 55-5 record. The Warriors handled the Spurs the last time the teams met, and Martin gives them another shooter off the bench who could also help ease Manu Ginobili's transition back after missing a month with a testicle injury.
10a055fb-3a26-4b7e-9c8a-3879ec8ad03a  — Baron Davis kept his expectations low for his first professional basketball game in four years.

"I'm not dunking," he said, smiling.

One game into his comeback, the 36-year-old Davis already proved himself wrong.

Alone in the open court, Davis sprinted toward the basket on the fast break and threw down a two-handed slam dunk.

Davis was back.

OK, it's not the NBA, where Davis was a two-time All-Star over 13 seasons and the No. 3 overall pick of the 1999 draft. He was just a backup point guard Friday night for the D-League Delaware 87ers. But the uniform hardly mattered as much as the comeback did - Davis played for the first time since May 6, 2012, when he tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his right knee in a playoff game with the New York Knicks.

Far removed from the bright lights of Madison Square Garden, Davis played in front of a few thousand fans at a college arena.

But basketball hadn't felt this good for Davis in years.

"I just never thought I'd be playing again," Davis said before the game. "I'm kind of just treating it as a new experience."

Wearing his usual white headband, Davis dunked and dished for the Sevens in a 114-106 loss to the Iowa Energy.

Davis scored eight points on 3-of-11 shooting with four assists, three steals and five fouls in 19 minutes.

"I think a lot of it was happening in my brain," Davis said. "I was playing, I was out there, but I wasn't all the way out there."

He surprised himself with his dunk.

"I thought it was LeBron James coming to block it. I didn't want to lay it up," he said. "I thought, while I'm up here, I might as well try."

While an NBA return remains the ultimate goal, just suiting up for the Sevens was a personal victory for Davis. The last time the basketball world saw Davis, he pressed his hands to his head in pain as he was taken off the MSG court on a stretcher.

Davis crumbled when his knee gave out as he dribbled upcourt on a fast break. Some players looked away as replays of the gruesome injury were shown on the overhead video board.

Davis also suffered a partial tear of the patella tendon and was told he'd need at least a year to recover. It took almost three.

"When I got hurt, I kind of wanted to give myself amnesia as far as being a basketball player," Davis said.

What fueled his rehabilitation, though, was what Davis could not forget - the final image of himself on the court was on a stretcher, not walking away on his own terms.

He played pickup games in the Los Angeles area with NBA players and worked out at his alma mater, UCLA. Davis - who averaged 16.1 points and 7.2 assists over 835 career games - truly got the itch to return around November. His agent put out feelers and there were offers from the ABA and overseas, but Davis stayed patient and his name was entered early this year in the D-League available player pool.

Davis sat unclaimed, unwanted.

The Sevens had two of the top D-League guards until Sean Kilpatrick and Jordan McRae, their top scorers, recently signed 10-day NBA contracts with Brooklyn and Cleveland, respectively.

So why not take a run at Davis?

The 87ers are affiliated with the 76ers. Davis is free to sign with any NBA team, but he isn't expecting a call-up any time soon.

"I made it this far, which is crazy," he said. "This is my NBA right now."

Davis practiced once, went through shootaround with the Sevens and entered for the first time with 6:44 left in the first quarter. He missed a pull-up jumper on his first shot, then slammed home two points with 1:06 left in the quarter.

"He's so smart, that's the thing that stood out above everything. I don't know if that's an indictment on our guys or if he's a just a guy with that much experience," Sevens coach Kevin Young said, laughing.

Davis took the microphone before the game, thanked fans for attending and wished "best of luck for both teams."

Davis will ride the team bus at 5 a.m. Saturday to hit the airport for the first of two commercial flights to Iowa for the next game. No first class. No gourmet meals. And the Ritz Carlton? Try a night at the Quality Inn.

"The fact that Baron's doing this, you've got to love basketball," Young said. "I don't know if he knows exactly what he's getting into."
7ed7c59c-c0c7-4fe9-844d-f14d6c1a24f9  — Cavaliers forward Kevin Love won't play against Washington, part of Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue's plans to rest his starters.

Love will sit out Friday's game against the Wizards, who beat the Cavs on Sunday when LeBron James sat out. The Cavs, who lead the Eastern Conference by two games over Toronto heading into the weekend, will play three games in the next four days. They host Boston on Saturday night.

Lue wants to get his starters and rotational players some rest as the Cavs gear up for the playoffs and make a run at their second straight Finals.

Cleveland hasn't played since Monday, but Lue decided to extend the break for Love.

James is expected to sit out some upcoming games. As of Thursday, James said he and Lue had not yet outlined a strategy to get him some time off.
46e785cd-6c8f-4f9c-b303-84e1bbb325df  — The Houston Rockets have signed free agent forward Michael Beasley.

Beasley, who was the second overall pick in the 2008 draft, spent this season in the Chinese Basketball Association, where he averaged 31.9 points, 13.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.0 steals.

The 27-year-old last played in the NBA in 2014-15. He appeared in 24 games for the Miami Heat, with whom he averaged 8.8 points and 3.7 rebounds.

Beasley spent his first two seasons with the Heat before returning to Miami in 2013. In between those stints, he played for the Timberwolves and the Suns. He's averaged 13 points and 4.8 rebounds in seven NBA seasons.
5705bb8c-5361-4ab3-8bda-fe2727910f8b  — Stephen Curry is set to return to the starting lineup for the Golden State Warriors after missing a game with a sprained left ankle.

The Warriors announced Curry was active for Thursday night's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Golden State also says forward Andre Iguodala will play after missing the previous game with a tight left hamstring.

Curry hurt the ankle Saturday in Oklahoma City but returned to that game and tied an NBA record with 12 3-pointers, including the game-winner from 37 feet in overtime. Curry sat out Tuesday night's game against Atlanta but practiced the past two days and took his usual pregame warmups before being declared active.

Golden State is looking to tie Chicago's NBA record with a 44th straight regular-season home win.
15091b4d-a189-4ef0-8c68-74dd69382387  — Memphis Grizzlies minority owner Steve Kaplan's pursuit of a new role in the ownership group of the Minnesota Timberwolves has hit a wall, two people with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on Thursday.

Kaplan and partner Handy Soetedjo met with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor before the game against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night to talk about the status of a process that began about four months ago. The two have been spearheading a group trying to acquire 30 percent of the Timberwolves, with the possibility of taking over majority ownership from Taylor down the road. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the talks.

But Kaplan owns a significant stake in the Grizzlies along with Robert Pera and others, which has complicated his ability to divest himself from Memphis.

League rules prohibit ownership stakes in two teams. So Kaplan's inability to remove himself from Memphis has prevented a Minnesota deal to this point. Neither person involved in the discussions would say the deal was dead, but both acknowledged that Kaplan's exit from Memphis has been more complex than expected.

Taylor has long been in search of a person or group willing to buy in to a minority share of the Timberwolves, sit by his side for a few years and then eventually take over the team. After having difficulty finding anyone open to riding shotgun first, Taylor opened discussions with Kaplan in November.

Kaplan was in the bidding to acquire the Atlanta Hawks last year, but was outbid by Tony Ressler's group, and had been very enthusiastic about getting involved with a Timberwolves team stocked with young talent and equipped with a shiny new practice facility and renovations to its arena scheduled to begin this summer.

Soetedjo is an Indonesian coal magnate who was among the initial investors in a group that bought the Philadelphia 76ers in 2011. He also is part of the ownership group that bought 70 percent of the Inter Milan soccer team in 2013.

Talks centered around a plan to purchase 30 percent of the Timberwolves by the end of this season and then, an unspecified time later, purchasing a majority share when Taylor was ready to relinquish full control. Taylor and Kaplan built a mutual respect during the negotiations, but with no quick fix to Kaplan's situation readily apparent, discussions have stalled.

With a deal of this scale, there can always be stops and starts, hurdles and road blocks. So there remains the possibility that the issues can be resolved and things can move forward. But what was certain after the meeting on Wednesday night was that the timeline would not be as prompt as both sides hoped when talks began in earnest in November.

The standstill could have ramifications in Minnesota.

Both sides were hoping to complete a deal before the end of the season to allow Kaplan to come aboard and give input into several major decisions facing the franchise. Two of the biggest are the fates of GM Milt Newton and coach Sam Mitchell, both of whom are essentially working on an interim basis after taking over for Flip Saunders, who was both president of basketball operations and coach before he died in October from Hodgkin's lymphoma.
ef54f6e7-3072-44e6-b932-ce077b0121d3  — Federal authorities sought Thursday to drop a criminal indictment of bid rigging against Oklahoma energy tycoon Aubrey McClendon, who died in a fiery single-car crash just hours after the indictment was announced.

Meanwhile, attorneys for a northwest Oklahoma landowner filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against McClendon's former company, Chesapeake Energy, alleging a conspiracy that involved another energy executive, ex-Sandridge Energy CEO Tom Ward.

The U.S. Department of Justice's Chicago-based antitrust division alleged in the indictment against McClendon that he and unnamed co-conspirators orchestrated the conspiracy to rig bids for landowner leases in northwest Oklahoma. Ward, a longtime friend of McClendon's who co-founded Chesapeake in the 1980s, was the CEO of Sandridge at the time the conspiracy was alleged to have occurred.

Justice Department spokesman Mark Abueg declined Thursday to confirm that Ward and Sandridge are the unindicted co-conspirators or that its investigation into the conspiracy is ongoing. Messages seeking comment Thursday from Ward and Sandridge were not immediately returned.

But Warren Burns, one of the attorneys who filed the class-action lawsuit, said it appears Ward and Sandridge Energy are the unindicted co-conspirators listed in the indictment against McClendon.

"Based on a number things, we think they are likely the unindicted co-conspirators," Burns said.

Sandridge previously disclosed in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it was the subject of a grand jury investigation into violations of federal antitrust law and that it is cooperating with federal investigators.

Chesapeake also has said it is cooperating with investigators.

Ward was ousted from Oklahoma City-based Sandridge in 2013 after a monthslong proxy fight and later formed his own company, Tapstone Energy LLC.

Ward and McClendon co-founded the natural gas giant Chesapeake Energy in 1989 with a handshake deal and an initial $50,000 investment and helped grow the company into one of the nation's largest independent producers of natural gas in the United States.

McClendon also was a part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.

State officials say investigations into McClendon's death could take months to complete. Oklahoma City police Sgt. Ashley Peters said a probe of Wednesday's crash likely will take up to two weeks, while the state medical examiner's office says an autopsy investigation could take as long as three months.
a6d09650-dcc8-47d6-98fc-dfeb082ec797  — The New Orleans Pelicans say 7-foot-2 center Alexis Ajinca will be sidelined indefinitely because of a fractured sternum.

The Pelicans say the diagnosis came after Ajinca had an MRI before Thursday night's home game against the San Antonio Spurs.

Ajinca was injured during the fourth quarter of Wednesday night's loss at Houston.

A French national now in his sixth year in the NBA, Ajinca has played in 47 games this season with nine starts, averaging 4.4 points and 4.0 rebounds.

Ajinca's injury comes with 7-foot center Omer Asik, a starter, out with a right ankle sprain.

The Pelicans also have lost forward Quincy Pondexter (left knee), guard Tyreke Evans (right knee) and guard Bryce Dejean-Jones (right wrist) for the season.
0b6125e0-9f42-46b5-bdd5-deb91174a116  — LeBron James didn't want to discuss his cryptic tweet, his quick trip to hang out with Dwyane Wade in Florida or much of anything.

It's good to be the king.

Following an unusual two-day break in their schedule, James and the Cavaliers returned to practice on Thursday to prepare for a stretch of three games in four nights. James met with reporters afterward, but the four-time league MVP wasn't in the mood to elaborate on his actions or whereabouts over the past few days.

On Tuesday, James posted a message on Twitter to his 28.5 million followers that seemed to be directed at one person.

"It's ok to know you've made a mistake," James wrote. "Cause we all do at times. Just be ready to live with whatever that comes with it and be with those who will protect you at all cost!"

The posting created speculation about its intended target, stirring up even more drama around the Cavaliers, but James refused to elaborate on his intentions.

James bluntly answered "No" when he was asked if he wanted to explain the tweet, which had some wondering if he was conspicuously calling out one of his teammates - something he has done on social media in the past.

"Nope," James said when asked if that was the case.

Of more concern to Clevelanders was James' visit to Miami, where he hung out with good friend and former teammate Wade, a potential playoff opponent this year. James went on the trip with his wife, Savannah, who has kept a business in Miami. And although James sold his mansion there last summer, he spent part of his offseason training in South Florida.

So why did he go there this time?

"Cause I want to," he said. "I would love to go to L.A., but I'll take 2 1/2 (hours of flight time to Miami) over 4 1/2 (flight to Los Angeles). "I've got a house in L.A. but it makes more sense for me to go south than go west. But I go because I want to."

The sight of he and Wade working out together is the last thing Cavs fans want to see, especially since James continues to sign one-year contracts with Cleveland and because he has left his home state before.

James was asked if he understands why some people might be upset he would meet with Wade.

"Yeah," he said. "I don't care."

James recently sat out Sunday's game at Washington and Cavs coach Tyronn Lue intends to sit him - and Cleveland's other starters - during some upcoming games so they're rested for the postseason and another run at an NBA title. The Cavs host the Wizards on Friday, Boston on Saturday and Memphis on Monday.

James said he and Lue have not yet discussed plans for time off.

"I'm going to go with what coach believes is the best for the team, believe is best for me," James said.

Lue, who took over when the Cavs fired David Blatt earlier this season, said he wants to have his rotation finalized with six or seven games left in the regular season.

"My whole thing is going into the playoffs you want to be on a good roll and playing good going into the playoffs, so, that's my thought, that's my philosophy," he said. "We'll still get guys rest when we have the chance to."

James concluded his nine-minute interview session by asking reporters if it was OK for him to leave.

He then said, "love you guys" before walking away.

Not long after, James went back on Twitter to post another mysterious message: "Can't replace being around great friends that reciprocate the same energy back to you in all facets of life."

If he's talking about Wade, he probably won't admit it.
0457663e-19c8-40ee-b3dc-23cbb80d7e87  — The Indiana Pacers' Myles Turner and the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Rookies of the Month, respectively, for games played in February.

Turner, who earned Rookie of the Month honors for the first time, ranked third among East first-year players in scoring (13.4 ppg), rebounding (6.6 rpg) and minutes (29.8 mpg).

3ed70e16-5778-4d05-bba4-a46b18f4e5c3  — The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Month, respectively, for games played in February.

James led the East in scoring (24.8 ppg) and finished tied for second in assists (7.3 apg) as the Cavaliers went 8-5 for the month (8-4 with James in the lineup). He added 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 steals while shooting 49.6 percent from the field.

Curry tied the NBA record for three-pointers in a game with 12, capped by the last-second game-winner, in a 121-118 overtime win over the Thunder on Feb. 27. He also became the first player in NBA history to make at least 10 three-pointers in back-to-back games. During February, Curry broke his own single-season record for threes (he has now hit 288) and set the record for consecutive games with a three-pointer (now at 129).

Here is a closer look at February for James and Curry:

1dc3bd04-f207-4eb5-9e2b-3534fe8369e9  — Philadelphia 76ers forward Jerami Grant has been fined $10,000 for throwing a water bottle into the spectator stands, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

The incident occurred with 8:44 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Sixers' 116-108 loss to the Washington Wizards on Feb. 29 at Verizon Center.
4bcf8b28-9c5c-4554-bfa6-600799eaa3c6  — Carmelo Anthony says the decision to issue an apology for his interaction with a fan was made by Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan.

Anthony told a heckling fan Tuesday during the Knicks' loss to Portland to ask Dolan for his money back, pointing to the owner sitting nearby. On Wednesday, the Knicks sent a statement on Anthony's behalf in which he said he shouldn't have responded the way he did.

Anthony says he spoke to Dolan, who felt it would be best to apologize.

"It was Mr. Dolan's decision," Anthony says Thursday after practice.

Anthony adds that it was written in collaboration with the Knicks, saying: "We sat down and we talked about it. Everybody thought it would be a good idea to send out an apology."

A spokesman for Dolan declined to comment.

Anthony has been frustrated as the Knicks have lost 15 of 18. He missed a team charity bowling event Wednesday, with the Knicks saying he was excused for personal reasons.
4455e8d9-b9bd-422e-8ff1-3d2ccb80aa25  — Federal authorities are seeking to dismiss a charge of bid rigging against Oklahoma energy tycoon Aubrey McClendon, who died in a fiery car crash just hours after the indictment was announced.

The U.S. Department of Justice's Chicago-based antitrust division filed a motion to dismiss the bid rigging conspiracy indictment on Thursday in federal court in Oklahoma City.

Federal prosecutors alleged the 56-year-old former chief executive of Chesapeake Energy orchestrated a scheme between two large energy companies to decide ahead of time which would win bids on oil and gas landowner leases.

The two large energy companies were not named in the indictment, but McClendon was CEO of Chesapeake during the time the scheme was alleged.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Thursday on the case.

McClendon died in a single-car crash Wednesday in Oklahoma City.

State officials say investigations into the death of energy magnate Aubrey McClendon in a fiery single-car crash in Oklahoma City could take months to complete.

Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Ashley Peters says a probe of Wednesday's crash likely will take up to two weeks, while the state medical examiner's office says an autopsy investigation could take as long as three months.

Police say McClendon's Chevrolet Tahoe slammed into a concrete embankment and burst into flames, killing the 56-year-old energy company CEO.

Several passing motorists called 911 shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday to report a vehicle on fire at an underpass beneath Interstate 44 in northeast Oklahoma City.

McClendon had been indicted just hours earlier by a federal grand jury on charges of gas-lease bid rigging.
32672191-80f1-4731-8849-d61535a8a71d  After mid-February's trade deadline. let's see how six players dealt two weeks ago are performing on their new teams:

Tobias Harris, Pistons

Harris has arguably been the most productive player of any dealt two weeks ago. In seven games for Detroit, Harris is averaging 16.9 points on 50.0 percent shooting, 1.4 3-pointers, 5.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 32.7 minutes. The Pistons are 4-1 since inserting Harris into the starting lineup, with their first loss coming in San Antonio on Wednesday. Coach Stan Van Gundy already "feels comfortable when [Harris] has the ball", and one would assume that confidence will continue to grow over the final six weeks of the regular season. Harris looks to be a great fit in Detroit and his fantasy owners should be pleased with his increased production.

Brandon Jennings & Ersan Ilyasova, Magic

The other end of the Harris-to-Detroit trade saw Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova shipped to Orlando. Ilyasova has been more efficient in Orlando, but has received almost 10 less minutes per game over his first eight games with the Magic. Jennings has also seen less action than many expected with averages of 7.9 points on 36.2 percent shooting, 1.4 3-pointers, 3.6 assists and 1.8 rebounds in 17.4 minutes. Both players are notorious for their hot streaks, so keep an eye on their production and don't be afraid to pick them up if it seems they're starting to find a groove. Coach Scott Skiles could decide to rely on these veterans more as the Magic continue to chase the playoffs. But at the moment, neither are worth rostering in standard leagues.

Markieff Morris, Wizards

The talented-yet-complicated forward received his wish two weeks ago when Phoenix sent him to Washington. Unfortunately for Morris and the Wizards, the transaction hasn't reaped many benefits yet. In eight games with Washington, Morris is averaging 8.0 points on 36.5 percent from the field, 7.1 percent (!) from 3-point, 5.9 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 0.8 blocks in 24.1 minutes. His minutes have increased to 30.7 over the last two games after entering the starting lineup. But his field goal percentage still makes him an unsavory addition. If he can bring that category up on a consistent basis, he's very much worth consideration for his unique combination of points, rebounds, steals and blocks.

Jeff Green, Clippers

Doc Rivers and the Clippers snagged Green from the Grizzlies two weeks ago with the hope he could solidify their stable of bench bigs. The returns have been mixed so far. In six games with Los Angeles, Green is averaging 9.7 points on 41.1 percent shooting, 1.2 3-pointers, 4.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 24.7 minutes. This stretch includes a 22-point outing against the Kings with four 3-pointers and five rebounds. It seems Green's role will be similar to what it was in Memphis, where he could score 20-plus points on any given night but didn't provide consistent enough statistics to be worthy of a roster spot in standard leagues. Green should be a good plug-and-play option for the remainder of the regular season if you need points, 3-pointers or rebounds. Just don't plan to keep him on your roster for more than a couple games at a time.

Lance Stephenson, Grizzlies

The player who the Clippers used to acquire Green has been solid with the Grizzlies over his first six games with averages of 11.8 points on 51.8 percent shooting, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 22.5 minutes. These minutes are solid for Stephenson, but his game doesn't translate well to the fantasy world as he doesn't hit 3-pointers or accumulate many defensive stats. There isn't much reason for Stephenson to be on your fantasy roster unless he's a weekend pickup to chase points and rebounds.

Stat Line of the Week

Nightly Notable: Stephen Curry Steph Curry torched the opposition for 46 points, including 12 3-pointers to lead the Warriors over the Thunder in overtime.

February 27 vs. Oklahoma City -- 46 points (14-24 FG, 12-16 3P, 6-8 FT), six assists, three rebounds, two steals, three turnovers in 38 minutes

Weekend Pickups

Bobby Portis, Bulls (26 percent owned)

The Bulls rookie continues to receive solid minutes with Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson out of the lineup for Chicago. Over his last three games, Portis is averaging 10.0 points on 45.2 percent shooting, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 27.0 minutes. He's worth a look this weekend if you need rebounds with a dash of everything else. The Bulls matchup with the Rockets on Saturday.

D.J. Augustin, Nuggets (10 percent owned)

The newest Nugget has been up-and-down over his first seven games in Denver with averages of 13.0 points on 48.3 percent shooting, 1.9 3-pointers, 3.7 assists and 1.6 rebounds in 23.2 minutes. He scored a season-high 26 points on Wednesday against the Lakers with three 3-pointers and five assists in 23 minutes. He's worth a look this weekend if you need points, 3-pointers and assists. The Nuggets matchup with the Nets on Friday and the Mavericks on Sunday.

Mario Hezonja, Magic (6 percent owned)

The Magic rookie dominated for a career-high 21 points in 37 minutes on Tuesday as he fills in for Evan Fournier (wrist) in Orlando's starting lineup. Magic coach Scott Skiles is notoriously sporadic with his playing time, so Hezonja could drop back down to his normal playing time any game. But if Fournier is out of the lineup again this weekend (he's questionable) then Hezonja is worth a look for points, 3-pointers and rebounds. The Magic host the Suns on Friday.
4cc3d382-86a3-44bb-9e27-4dfd8ac285ed  — Manu Ginobili said Wednesday night that he is pain free and will return to the San Antonio Spurs next week after missing a month following testicle surgery.

Ginobili has missed 11 games and will wear a protective cup when he returns from the worst injury of his career. He is unsure when he will play, but the Spurs have five games in eight days beginning Sunday at home against Sacramento.

The Argentina native addressed the media just before San Antonio played the Detroit Pistons in its first home game following its annual monthlong Rodeo Road Trip.

"I'm happy to be starting to just think about playing," he said. "For a week (after the injury), I didn't care about playing. I was struggling. I was in pain and I didn't care. (Retiring was) not realistic, but I thought, `I don't care, I just want to feel good.' It was bad."

Ginobili said he has been participating in team activities, including practicing and conditioning. Ginobili on Feb. 3 took a knee directly to the groin from Ryan Anderson when the New Orleans Pelicans forward spun quickly in the lane against Ginobili and rose for a short jumper.

The 38-year-old guard was down on the court for several minutes before being assisted to the locker room by Tim Duncan and Spurs trainers. Team doctors had Ginobili undergo surgery that evening after he continued to experience great pain two hours after the injury occurred.

Ginobili said he has no plans to change the breakneck, dynamic style of play that has defined his 14-year career despite the traumatic injury.

"I don't think anything can happen," he said. "I don't know once I'm better if I'm going to step to get a charge. I don't know if the instincts are going to kick in or I'm going to be more worried. I don't know. Once I start practicing or competing, I'll figure it out."

Ginobili is averaging 10 points, 3.3 assists and 3.0 rebounds in 19.7 minutes per game.
1bc05b68-963e-4745-9971-6e7135ae1d63  — Former NBA All-Star Baron Davis is attempting a comeback, starting with the Philadelphia 76ers' developmental league team.

Davis signed with the Delaware 87ers on Wednesday. The 6-foot-3, 215-pound Davis hasn't played since the 2011-12 season because of a variety of injuries.

Davis was the No. 3 overall selection in the 1999 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He made two All-Star teams, one All-NBA selection and averaged 16.1 points and 7.2 assists over 835 career games.

Davis should play for Delaware on Friday night.
5d0ae43e-7850-4549-bd5c-18a33279bf1a  — The Delaware 87ers on Wednesday announced the team has acquired former NBA All-Star Baron Davis from the available player pool.

"Our organizational efforts continue to center on finding, developing, and providing opportunity to talented professionals," said Philadelphia 76ers Chief of Staff and Delaware 87ers General Manager, Brandon D. Williams. "Baron still has much to contribute to the game, and we are excited to play a role as he transitions through the next phase of his successful career."

The 6-foot-3, 215 pound guard most recently played for the New York Knicks during the 2011-12 season, where he appeared in 29 games, averaging 6.1 points and 4.7 assists in 20.5 minutes per game. Davis, a two-time NBA All-Star and former All-NBA selection, has 835 NBA games on his resume, with career averages of 16.1 points, 7.2 assists and 3.8 rebounds in 34.2 minutes per game.

A two-year starter at the University of California, Los Angeles, Davis was the No. 3 overall selection in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets.

The 87ers next home game is Friday, March 4, with tip scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark.
2b82b651-05ef-4ca5-8df1-c63c75ef6321  — Aubrey McClendon, a natural gas industry titan, was killed when police say he drove his sport utility vehicle "straight into a wall" in Oklahoma City on Wednesday, a day after he was indicted on a charge of conspiring to rig bids to buy oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma.

Police Capt. Paco Balderrama said McClendon, co-founder of Chesapeake Energy and a part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, was the only occupant in the vehicle when it slammed into a concrete bridge embankment shortly after 9 a.m.

"He pretty much drove straight into the wall," Balderrama said. "The information out there at the scene is that he went left of center, went through a grassy area right before colliding into the embankment. There was plenty of opportunity for him to correct and get back on the roadway and that didn't occur."

McClendon's death follows an announcement Tuesday that he had been indicted by a federal grand jury.

In a statement released Wednesday by the Thunder, chairman Clayton I. Bennett said:

"I am overcome with grief. Aubrey McClendon was a visionary community leader, a trusted business partner and a passionate member of the Thunder family. But more than anything, he was a brother and a dear friend. His love of his community and his desire to make Oklahoma a better place will forever inspire all of us. Louise and I offer our love and prayers to Katie and the McClendon family."

Balderrama says it's too early to say if the collision was intentional. He said McClendon was not wearing a seat belt and that he was driving faster than the 50 mph speed limit.

The Department of Justice said in a statement Tuesday that McClendon, 56, was suspected of orchestrating a scheme between two large energy companies, which are not named in the indictment, from December 2007 to March 2012. The companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, according to the statement.

In a statement released Tuesday after his indictment, McClendon denied violating antitrust laws.

"The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented," McClendon said. "Anyone who knows me, my business record and the industry in which I have worked for 35 years, knows that I could not be guilty of violating any antitrust laws. All my life I have worked to create jobs in Oklahoma, grow its economy, and to provide abundant and affordable energy to all Americans. I am proud of my track record in this industry, and I will fight to prove my innocence and to clear my name."

Department of Justice spokesman Mark Abueg declined to comment on the impact McClendon's death would have on the case.

McClendon could frequently be spotted in his courtside seats near the Thunder bench in the arena named after the company he founded in 1989 with his friend, Tom Ward, with an initial $50,000 investment. They eventually grew the company into one of the largest independent producers of natural gas in the United States. He left the company in January 2013 amid philosophical differences with a new board of directors, and founded American Energy Partners, where he was chairman and CEO.

"Aubrey's tremendous leadership, vision, and passion for the energy industry had an impact on the community, the country, and the world," AEP said in a statement. "We are tremendously proud of his legacy and will continue to work hard to live up to the unmatched standards he set for excellence and integrity."

McClendon was renowned for his aggression and skill in acquiring oil and gas drilling rights. As drillers learned to unlock natural gas from shale formations over the last decade, McClendon pushed the company to acquire enormous tracks of land in several states. The strategy landed the company promising assets, boosted the company's own production and helped fuel the national boom in natural gas production. But it saddled Chesapeake with enormous debt.

Chesapeake eventually became victim of its own success. Natural gas prices plummeted along with all the new drilling by Chesapeake and its peers, reducing revenues for the company and making the debt harder to repay.

Chesapeake's 20-acre campus sprawls through an exclusive area of Oklahoma City, its Georgian-style brick buildings surrounded by manicured lawns and sycamore and elm trees.

McClendon's death is the second fatal crash this year connected to the Thunder organization. Assistant coach Monty Williams' wife, Ingrid, died Feb. 10 after she was involved in a head-on crash in Oklahoma City.
e419dfe5-4d6c-4f6e-a84e-eeee6c9fab57  — Carmelo Anthony is apologizing for his interaction with a fan during the New York Knicks' latest loss.

The All-Star forward said Wednesday in a statement that he was frustrated but shouldn't have responded the way he did.

Anthony said after Tuesday's 104-85 home loss to Portland that the fan was yelling at him, vowing to never come to another Knicks game. Anthony pointed to Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan and told the fan: "Look, the owner's right there. Ask for your money back."

The Knicks have lost 15 of their last 18 games.

Anthony says: "We are all frustrated by the team's recent results - everyone, including me, my teammates, coaches and the fans. Last night, a fan and I let those frustrations get the best of us. I should not have responded the way I did."
b5311d67-7204-4688-aa2f-ebcde25404b2  — With the clock ticking down to the final minutes, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Kevin Martin agreed to a buyout of the veteran shooting guard's contract late Tuesday night.

Martin confirmed the agreement in a text message to The Associated Press shortly before the 11 p.m. deadline for him to be eligible to play in the postseason for another team. With the Timberwolves near the bottom of the Western Conference with a young and rebuilding roster, the 33-year-old Martin ultimately decided to take the buyout to pursue a spot on a team that is headed to the playoffs.

Martin thanked Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor and his wife Becky for their support over the last two-plus seasons in Minnesota, saying they provided "first-class treatment" since his first day with the team.

Martin signed a four-year deal in 2013 that included a player option at about $7.4 million for next season. That option became a sticking point with some teams during trade talks last month, with some potential suitors not wanting to take on the possibility of more money on the salary cap for next season. When the trade deadline passed, Martin and the Wolves eventually engaged in buyout talks that dragged on for five days before Martin ultimately decided to take the deal.

Martin has been one of the most consistent shooters in the league over the last decade and could provide a big boost off the bench for a team like San Antonio, Cleveland or Dallas. But he has struggled this season, averaging just 10.6 points and shooting 36.9 percent from 3-point range in 39 games. He dealt with a wrist injury early in the season and had not played much recently because the Wolves did not want to risk him getting injured while they were discussing possible trades.

ESPN first reported the buyout.

Martin also thanked the Adelman and Saunders families for the time they spent with him in Minnesota. One of the reasons Martin decided to sign with the Timberwolves was the presence of coach Rick Adelman, who had worked with Martin in Sacramento and Houston. Adelman coached Martin with the Timberwolves before retiring in part to help his wife, Mary Kay, seek treatments for a seizure disorder.

Flip Saunders was the man who signed Martin with the Wolves, and he died suddenly just before this season started after a battle with Hodgkin lymphoma.

"The past two years have been the toughest to witness what you guys have gone through," Martin texted, referencing assistant coaches Ryan Saunders and David Adelman, who are the sons of Flip Saunders and Rick Adelman. "Just know it has helped me respect more than just the game. I was blessed to learn so much, on and off the court, from my favorite two NBA legacy families."

Martin also thanked his "brothers in that locker room," athletic trainers Arnie Kander, Gregg Farnam and Mark Kyger, strength coaches David Crewe and Koichi Sato and equipment manager Clayton Wilson and assistant Cory Johnson.
1aeb8eb6-5376-4bed-9ce7-65a21e1ee663  — Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey announced today that the team has waived guard Ty Lawson.

Lawson (5-11,195) is in his seventh NBA season.

He appeared In 53 games with 12 starts for the Rockets this season.
01293e2e-14c5-4801-b3fe-3fdafaea6ca5  — Oklahoma honored former star Blake Griffin by raising his jersey to the rafters in a ceremony at halftime of the Sooners' game against Baylor on Tuesday night.

Griffin was named the AP National Player of the Year in 2008-09 after averaging 22.7 points and 14.4 rebounds per game and leading the nation in rebounding and double-doubles. The Sooners finished 30-6 that season and reached the Elite Eight.

"I didn't know what I was going to feel, what to expect," Griffin said. "Anytime I come back here, it's such a family atmosphere. It's home. I'm a little bit overwhelmed with emotion and like I said, incredibly honored to be able to be up there. Very appreciative of everybody."

His jersey joins those of men's players Alvan Adams, Wayman Tisdale, Stacey King and Mookie Blaylock. Tisdale also wore No. 23, and Griffin personally asked Tisdale if he could wear the number.

Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, has missed two months while recovering from a partially torn left quadriceps tendon. He broke his hand punching Clippers assistant equipment manager Matias Testi and will serve a four-game suspension for that incident when healthy. Griffin said he'll be ready to play soon.

"Very close," he said. "I'm not exactly sure a timetable, but very close."
ee453a62-8789-4428-b0a0-07e9a76bc7fd  — Stephen Curry is out for the Golden State Warriors' game Tuesday night against Atlanta with an injured left ankle.

Coach Steve Kerr was leaning toward sitting Curry after he hurt his ankle Saturday night at Oklahoma City before returning to hit the long 3-pointer to win it in overtime. Curry's ankle became worse Sunday and he said it wasn't worth risking playing on it if it would mean setting himself back further.

Curry has three straight 40-point games. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday for his fourth such honor this season - he's the first in franchise history to win four in one season. He averaged 43.8 points, 7.3 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals while the Warriors went 4-0.

Kerr planned to start Shaun Livingston in Curry's place.

Andre Iguodala also was sidelined while dealing with tightness in his left hamstring.
000f78aa-3b79-482b-93e7-84cf4035af9b  — The Atlanta Hawks signed veteran forward Kris Humphries on Tuesday night, adding experienced depth to their front line.

Humphries was waived by Phoenix on Sunday after averaging 7.3 points in four games. He was 0 for 9 from the field in his last game against the Nets on Thursday.

He began the season with Washington, where he averaged 6.4 points in 28 games, including 14 starts.

"As we explored opportunities to add to our team after the trade deadline, we felt it was important to prioritize experience and versatility," Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. "Kris is a versatile veteran with playoff experience who fits well with our group and within our system. We are fortunate to have Kris join our team and would like to welcome him to the Hawks family."

Atlanta announced the move before its game at Golden State.

The 6-foot-9 Humphries has career averages of 6.9 points and 5.4 rebounds with Utah, Toronto, Dallas, Brooklyn, Boston, Washington and Phoenix. He was a first-round pick by Utah in 2004.

The Hawks' front-line depth took a hit when center Tiago Splitter, acquired last summer from San Antonio, was sidelined by a lingering hip injury. The team announced last month that Splitter needed season-ending surgery.

Humphries will join Mike Scott and Mike Muscala as front-line options off the bench.

The Hawks also assigned guard Lamar Patterson to Canton of the NBA Development League.
881a267c-026d-4020-b5a9-f17a86eb2eb0  — The Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club has signed forward Kris Humphries, it was announced today by President of Basketball Operations/Head Coach Mike Budenholzer. Per team policy, terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

"As we explored opportunities to add to our team after the trade deadline, we felt it was important to prioritize experience and versatility," Budenholzer said. "Kris is a versatile veteran with playoff experience who fits well with our group and within our system. We are fortunate to have Kris join our team and would like to welcome him to the Hawks family."

Humphries, in his 12th NBA season, has recorded career regular season averages of 6.9 points and 5.6 rebounds in 18.3 minutes (.466 FG%, .696 FT%) in 723 games (199 starts) with Utah, Toronto, Dallas, Brooklyn, Boston, Washington and Phoenix.

He was originally selected in the first round (14th overall) of the 2004 NBA Draft by the Jazz following his freshman season at the University of Minnesota.

He will wear uniform no. 43.
3b20ec96-ebc9-45af-a7b8-12d0b93db389  — Joe Johnson's family is already with him in Miami, and if the seven-time All-Star gets his way they will not be moving again anytime soon.

The newly signed Heat forward said Tuesday that he and team President Pat Riley have had discussions about him finishing his career in Miami, one of the reasons why Johnson decided to sign with the team last week.

"The most important thing that Pat told me was that this wasn't just a short-term deal, that he would like for me to finish my career here," Johnson said. "And that's what we're working toward."

Johnson said he's on a year-to-year basis at this point in his career, but isn't planning on this being his finale.

Johnson was bought out by the Brooklyn Nets last week, cleared waivers Saturday afternoon and signed with the Heat not long afterward. He debuted for Miami in New York on Sunday night, and is making his home debut for the Heat on Tuesday night against Chicago.

His children, ages 9 and 2, accompanied him to town on Monday and Johnson said they were thrilled to get back to warm weather. It was their second time in Miami in a short span - the family also spent the All-Star break in South Florida, and Johnson has spent the past six or seven summers there relaxing and training.

"My kids have a ball here," Johnson said. "They're looking forward to this."

Johnson once owned a home in Miami, but sold it a couple years ago. He now sounds like he'll need another.

"He's planning on making the transition now," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

Johnson has been friends with Heat guard Dwyane Wade for about a decade, and long has raved about some of the things Miami has to offer. Tuesday was his first look at what life inside the arena is like for Heat players, and Johnson was duly impressed.

"I've heard they were very first-class," Johnson said. "But in the past couple days, I've seen a lot of things that I haven't seen in my 15-year career, so I've been impressed.

"How guys are so together and down for one another, that's a great bond and that's how you become a winning team."
bc556b98-1e57-4f94-89cb-64fe0a88aa73  — A person with knowledge of the deal says the Minnesota Timberwolves are planning to call up forward Greg Smith from the D-League for a 10-day contract.

The person tells The Associated Press that Smith was informed on Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been officially announced.

With Kevin Garnett, Nikola Pekovic and Nemanja Bjelica all out with injuries, the Timberwolves are in need of some depth in the front court. Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng are playing heavy minutes, and the Wolves want to reduce the load on their promising young big men.

The 6-foot-10 Smith played parts of three seasons with the Houston Rockets and played 42 games for the Dallas Mavericks last year. He has averaged 12.4 points in 16 games for the Raptors this season.
85503513-b122-4c71-a13e-250664c82c94  — The Boston Celtics' Brad Stevens and the Portland Trail Blazers' Terry Stotts today were named the NBA Eastern and Western Conference Coaches of the Month, respectively, for games played in February.

Stevens led the Celtics to the best record in the Eastern Conference (9-3) in February, which included a 6-0 mark at TD Garden. The Celtics scored 100-plus points in 10 of 12 games and led the conference in scoring at 110.8 points. Boston recorded wins against the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, and enters March with the East's third-best record (36-25).

Stotts guided the Trail Blazers to a 9-2 record in February, which included wins over the Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers. Portland ranked fourth in the NBA in scoring (110.6 points) and enjoyed the league's second-best point differential (+8.0 points). Stotts' Trail Blazers closed the month winning eight of their final nine games and enter March tied with the Dallas Mavericks' for sixth place in the Western Conference.

Other nominees for Coach of the Month were Charlotte's Steve Clifford, Golden State's Steve Kerr, San Antonio's Gregg Popovich and Toronto's Dwane Casey.
59ddfba2-9786-47a5-836f-8d9ffb315913  — The Toronto Raptors announced Tuesday they have signed NBA veteran power forward Jason Thompson. Per team policy, financial details were not disclosed.

Thompson, 6-foot-11, 250 pounds, is in his eighth season. He has appeared in 569 career regular season games, averaging 9.0 points, 6.7 rebounds and 25.5 minutes.

"We are pleased to add a player like Jason who has logged quality minutes in more than 500 career games," said Raptors President and General Manager Masai Ujiri.

A first-round selection (12th overall) by Sacramento in 2008, Thompson spent seven seasons with the Kings before joining Golden State this season. His best statistical campaign came in 2009-10 when he averaged 12.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 31.4 minutes.

To make room on the roster the Raptors released forward Anthony Bennett. Bennett appeared in 19 games, totaling 28 points, 23 rebounds and 84 minutes.

"We thank Anthony for his professionalism and for his service to our team and community," said Ujiri. "We know he's on his way to becoming an excellent NBA player but as we approach the end of the season Jason will provide us with a veteran presence that we need."

The Raptors return to action Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. versus Utah at Air Canada Centre (TSN/Sportsnet 590 The FAN).
ca1c71d6-190b-4d72-af72-6e1ffcfba39a  — Charlotte Hornets guard Jeremy Lin is disappointed about the way Asians were stereotyped during an onstage skit at Sunday night's Oscars, and said more racial awareness is needed.

"I just feel like sometimes the way people perceive Asians or Asian-Americans today can be disappointing in the way they view them," Lin said after the Hornets practice Tuesday morning. "Even Asian-American masculinity or whatever you want to talk about, just a lot of the ways that Asians are perceived I don't always agree with."

Lin was born in California, but his parents migrated here from Taiwan in the mid-1970s.

At Sunday night's awards show, host Chris Rock introduced three Asian children dressed in tuxedos as PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants and joked: "They sent us their most dedicated, accurate and hard-working representatives. I want you to please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz."

He later joked, "If anybody's upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was probably also made by these kids."

Lin took to social media on Monday by tweeting: Seriously though, when is this going to change?!? Tired of it being "cool" and "ok" to bash Asians smh (hash)Oscars

Lin wasn't the only one upset.

Mee Moua, president and executive director of the Washington-based Asian Americans Advancing Justice, called the show a setback for diversity in a statement Monday.

Sunday "night's ceremony, and particularly the `joke' involving Asian children, which played off more than one damaging stereotype of Asians and Asian Americans, exposed one of the failings of how we talk about race in America: race relations are not a black-white binary," Moua said. "It is to all of our detriment to look at race narrowly. We need to work together to dismantle the systems that devalue the experiences of minority groups so we can see the tales of the diversity that have shaped our nation reflected accurately."

Lin said he's never met Rock and has "no issues" with the comedian, calling him a "funny guy."

He understands that Rock probably didn't write the skit by himself, but couldn't let the perceived slight slip by without making a stand.

"I thought it was a chance for me to stand up for Asians," Lin said Tuesday.

Lin, who earned national attention while playing for the New York Knicks during the "Linsanity" era, said too often Asians are depicted with certain stereotypes in Hollywood.

"In acting, you look at Asian roles, they always seem to be in similar roles," Lin said. "I feel like we are just so much more broad than that. What you see on TV, that is so influential. Perception is reality and that's the truth it today's day and age where it such a digital and technological age.

"So if we can start branching out a little bit or at least showing that we are different than what other people think we are, maybe we can start to break down some of those walls."

Lin said his comments on Twitter aren't meant to bash Rock.

He said he actually enjoyed Rock's opening monologue earlier in the night when he talked about the lack of diversity in the Oscar award nominations.

"I think the whole push was he talking about opportunities and diversity and things that I totally agree with," Lin said. "I thought his monologue was well done. He walked a fine line and did it pretty well."
36263b1b-b7fe-4e39-906c-d9a08e30b26c  — The Golden State Warriors' stunning comeback win over the Oklahoma City Thunder is the most-watched non-Christmas NBA regular-season game since 2013.

The defending champions' 121-118 overtime victory Saturday night averaged more than 5.3 million viewers on ABC. ESPN said Tuesday that's the most since 5.4 million for the 2013-14 season opener between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls on TNT.

Saturday's broadcast drew nearly 8.1 million viewers during the overtime period.
7045f1be-baf0-47a4-bf2f-d2b457c7c525  Bulls vs. Heat (7:30 ET, NBA TV)

Starting To Sizzle

The Heat have won nine of their last 10 games against Eastern Conference opponents as they set to host Chicago on NBA TV tonight. This stretch of wins began on January 25th when Miami took down the Bulls 89-84 in their only matchup so far this season. Since the All-Star break, the Heat are 4-2 overall with all of their wins coming without Chris Bosh, who is dealing with blood clot issues. The addition of Joe Johnson (see below) should add a spark to the Miami offense as they hope to climb up the Eastern Conference standings over the final six weeks. Miami currently sits two games behind Boston for the No. 3 seed in the East.

Battered Bulls

On the other end of the spectrum, the Bulls are reeling as they continue to deal with a bevvy of injuries to key contributors. Jimmy Butler (knee), Nikola Mirotic (appendicitis) and Joakim Noah (shoulder) are all out for Chicago tonight. Derrick Rose (hamstring) will play after missing the last three games. On January 7th, the Bulls were the No. 2 seed in the East and only 2.5 games behind Cleveland for the top spot. Since then, Chicago has gone 8-16 and fallen into a tie for the Nos. 6 through 9 seeds with Detroit, Charlotte and Indiana. A loss tonight would knock the Bulls out of the top eight in the East for the first time since January 1, 2014. Pau Gasol will try to avoid that and continue his hot play of late as he averages 16.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists since the All-Star break. Doug McDermott has also been strong amid injuries with averages of 19.6 points on 10-for-20 from 3-point range over his last five games.

Welcome To Miami

Joe Johnson is set to make his home debut for the Heat after playing a key role in their win over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. The seven-time All-Star signed with Miami after agreeing to a buyout agreement with the Nets last week. On the season, Johnson is averaging 11.8 points on 40.8 percent shooting, 4.1 assists and 3.9 rebounds over 58 games. The Heat hope the 34-year-old guard can return to the form he displayed in 2013-14 and provide a needed offensive boost with Bosh sidelined. The Heat are 18-12 at home this season while Chicago has lost seven of their last eight games on the road.

Hawks vs. Warriors (10:30 ET, NBA TV)

Greatest Show On Hardwood

The Warriors return home with a record of 53-5 after going 5-1 on a six-game road trip following All-Star weekend. They stunned Oklahoma City and clinched a playoff spot on Saturday to become the first team to do so in February since the 1987-88 NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers. Much of the Warriors' success can be attributed to Stephen Curry, who continues to defy hyperbole with averages of 43.8 points (on 61.1 percent from 3-point range), 7.3 assists and 5.8 rebounds over his last four games. On the season, Curry has already hit an NBA-record 288 3-pointers, which has caused many to wonder if he will be able to reach 400 this season. With 24 games remaining, he would have to average 4.7 3-pointers a game to reach that incredible mark. Curry is a game-time decision after injuring his ankle against the Thunder on Saturday.

Defense Taking Flight

The Hawks struggled out of the gates this season, but it appears their trademark defense is finally starting to gel. Atlanta ranks first in defensive rating since January 1 with a record of 12-14 during that span. Obviously, offense is the issue for Atlanta as it ranks 25th in offensive rating over this stretch. The Hawks lost to the Warriors nine days ago in Atlanta as Curry and Klay Thompson outscored Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver 63-18. Atlanta will need much more production from those two tonight as it looks to climb up the tight Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks currently sit 2.5 games behind the No. 3 seed Celtics and two games in front of the No. 9 seed Pistons.

'Roaracle' Advantage

The Warriors have won 42 straight games at home and are 24-0 at Oracle Arena this season. They're two home wins shy of tying the Bulls for the longest home win streak in NBA history. Seventeen of the Warriors final 24 games are at home, which makes their pursuit of 73 wins seem even more realistic. The last team to beat the Warriors at home during the regular season were the Bulls on January 27, 2015. Will the Hawks be able to derail history tonight?

b82193b9-844b-4d7a-978e-5c108c1ccfc3  — The Los Angeles Clippers have unveiled a new mascot: Chuck the California Condor.

The bird made its entry at halftime of Monday night's game against Brooklyn. It was lowered from the rafters at Staples Center with the arena lights off.

Chuck is gray with a pink head, a large blue nose, wears a Clippers cape and has a red-and-white helmet that he removes.

"It's like us. It used to be extinct and now it's coming back," coach Doc Rivers said.

Team owner Steve Ballmer personally introduced the bird, which danced, did flips and dunked with the help of a trampoline.

The crowd was underwhelmed in its response until Ballmer announced that fans would receive a free pair of red Converse sneakers if the owner could successfully dunk. Ballmer did so using the trampoline and the crowd roared.

"In today's world, they're going to make fun of it for six months and then they're going to get over it," Rivers said.

The Clippers were one of four NBA teams without a mascot. Years ago, they had one named Sam Dunk when the franchise was located in San Diego.

Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford were supportive of the mascot, believing it will get kids more involved.

"I know my son will love it," Crawford said. "I hope my daughter's not scared."

The condor is the state bird of California.
df0e7bd8-ce71-4577-b249-1cea41574ad6  — The Spurs have signed 39-year-old guard Andre Miller four days after the oldest player on an NBA roster was waived by Minnesota.

The addition of Miller on Monday gives the Spurs the two oldest active players, according to STATS. Miller turns 40 on March 19, followed by Tim Duncan on April 25.

Miller had spent all season with the Timberwolves, his eighth team. The 17-year veteran averaged 3.4 points and 2.2 assists in 26 games.

The eighth overall pick by Cleveland in 1999, Miller has career averages of 12.6 points, 6.6 assists and 3.7 rebounds in 1,291 appearances, which ranks 20th on the career list. He is ninth in NBA history with 8,495 assists.

The Spurs also waived guard Ray McCallum.
de6460f5-8565-434c-9afc-261f588785ea  — Rookie forward Sam Dekker has returned to the Houston Rockets, just in time for a game Monday night against the Milwaukee Bucks and a trip back to his home state.

The former college star at Wisconsin and Houston's first-round draft pick was recalled from Rio Grande Valley of the NBA Development League on Sunday. He played sparingly for the Rockets in three November games before being sidelined by back surgery.

So it was happy coincidence for Dekker that his return came on a trip to Milwaukee, about an hour's drive south from his hometown of Sheboygan. Sitting at his locker pregame, Dekker was hunched over in a chair, busily sorting out ticket requests for friends and family.

"People are just handing them to me. I heard there were buses coming from Sheboygan with people," said Dekker, tickets laid out on the floor.

Dekker played an integral role on the Wisconsin teams that went to consecutive Final Fours in 2014-15. The high-energy forward averaged 19.2 points in last year's NCAA tournament and entered the draft following his breakout junior season.

His rookie year in the NBA hasn't quite gone as initially planned, but he said his back injury was caught early enough that "I'll be good to go for the rest of my career now. ... It is coming full circle and I'm happy to be healthy again."

Rockets coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Dekker's explosiveness is back following the injury. He also loved the smarts Dekker displayed during his D-League stint.

"Basketball IQ is the first thing that stands out," Bicketstaff said. "He can make the next pass or the next play, whether that's the finish or the kick-out pass. That fits perfectly for our system. He hit that game-winner in one of their games. He has that clutch gene in him."

The 6-foot-9 Dekker was a matchup problem in college with his inside-out game. Breaking into the rotation this season in Houston could be tough, though, especially with the Rockets hoping to secure a playoff spot.

"We're pretty heavy at the wing spot with the guys that we have," Bickerstaff said. "There's limited opportunity there. But again, he needs to be prepared to play."
0481177a-ca6d-430c-9d2a-0f91d718ca0b  — Rookie center Jahlil Okafor is day to day after missing Philadelphia's 116-108 loss at Washington with a bruised right shin.

Okafor got hurt during his 26-point performance in Sunday's loss at Orlando. The No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft is averaging 17.5 points and 7.0 rebounds.

Coach Brett Brown thinks the 20-year-old Okafor will only have to miss one game.
cdff2a72-2a1f-419b-a99f-89feab3eb1d4  — Cavaliers point guard Mo Williams will be sidelined for at least the next two weeks with an injured left knee.

Williams has been bothered by soreness in his knee for much of the season. He did not travel with the team for weekend losses at Toronto and Washington.

Coach Tyronn Lue said before Monday's game against Indiana that Williams will be re-evaluated "in a couple weeks."

Williams' playing time has reduced dramatically in the past two months. He began the season in Cleveland's starting lineup while Kyrie Irving recovered from offseason knee surgery. Williams has not played more than 20 minutes in a game since Dec. 11.

Last week, Williams visited famed orthopedist Dr. James Andrews, who diagnosed chondromalacia, irritation under the kneecap.

Williams is averaging 8.9 points and 19.7 minutes.

Also, Lue has juggled his lineup, starting Timofey Mozgov at center instead of Tristan Thompson.
f6d0a7df-b592-4080-b9c2-e851c87bb6b1  — Ralph Lawler is going Hollywood.

The veteran Los Angeles Clippers broadcaster is getting his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Lawler's star in the radio category will be dedicated on Thursday during a ceremony attended by Clippers coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers. The star will be located on Vine Street near a sports bar.

The 77-year-old broadcaster is in his 37th year handling play-by-play for the Clippers, making him the third-longest tenured broadcaster in the NBA. Lawler has broadcast more than 2,800 Clippers games during his career.

He will have the 2,575th star on the Walk of Fame.
7359be98-85fb-4b72-aeb6-2c3943e708cc  — Draymond Green's emotion and passion are what make him so valuable on the court for the Golden State Warriors, yet he acknowledges he took it too far this time.

The Golden State power forward apologized to his teammates, coaches and the organization for an emotional outburst during halftime of the Warriors' 121-118 overtime victory Saturday at Oklahoma City.

"I admit my mistakes. I made a mistake. I admitted my mistakes to my teammates, my coaching staff," Green said after practice Monday. "I apologized to my teammates and my coaching staff, this organization. That wasn't the right way to handle what needed to be handled. As a leader of this team, I can't do that because it sets a bad precedent how everything is ran around here, how everything should be ran, how everything has been ran and how everything will run going forward. It won't happen again. It's something where my emotions kind of got ahead of me and I let my emotions get the best of me."

After playing only two games at home in February, the Warriors (53-5) returned to the Bay Area and will have 17 of their final 24 games at Oracle Arena. They are 24-0 at home, riding a 42-game regular-season winning streak at Oracle overall, and chasing the Chicago Bulls' record of 72 wins from 1995-96.

Coach Steve Kerr expects the scrutiny at this stage.

"This is the way life is these days. There's 24-hour sports talk shows on the radio, on TV, and we're in the spotlight because of our record," Kerr said. "It doesn't bother us that everyone's talking about it. We know it was handled internally. We all love each other and we're good. ... You guys all know how emotional he is. That's one of the things that makes him great, is his passion and his intensity. I think we're doing OK. We won the championship last year, what's our record now, 53-5? I think his emotion is good for us.

"At times it bubbles over but for anybody to say, `Oh no, we should look out, what's coming next?' Come on."

Green also shot down reports that he threatened not to return for the second half against the Thunder, who watched Stephen Curry hit a long 3-pointer for the game-winner with .6 seconds left in overtime.

"I would never quit on my teammates as some have reported," Green said. "I would never quit on my coaching staff, I would never quit on this organization. This organization has given me everything I could ask for. I support and represent this organization to the best of my ability. That's not who I am, that's not who I've been and that's not who I will become."

Green leads the NBA with 11 triple-doubles. He responded - he said he was still mad - after his halftime debacle, finishing with 14 rebounds, 14 assists, six steals and two points against the Thunder.

"I felt I owed it to my team to give it everything I have," Green said. "I know when you're in the midst of a great season, people are going to latch onto certain stuff to try to tear it down. We're moving forward."

Reigning MVP Curry, questionable for Tuesday's game against Atlanta with a tender left ankle that he played through Saturday, said it is Green's emotional personality that makes him so valuable.

"We know he'll never quit, he'll never do anything to put our production on the floor in jeopardy," Curry said. "He's invested in what we're doing. Obviously he's an emotional guy, a fiery guy. That's what we love about him, what he brings to the court. It spilled over to the locker room but I've been in this league a long time, that wasn't the first time it's happened. The way we were able to respond was a testament to our team and him as an individual to understand it probably shouldn't have happened. We came out and stayed united."

Curry has three straight 40-point games and was named Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday for his fourth such honor this season - the first in franchise history to win four in one season. He averaged 43.8 points, 7.3 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 1.50 steals as the Warriors went 4-0.

Curry's ankle was worse Sunday and he didn't practice Monday so he could receive treatment.

"If I'm good enough to play and not put myself in jeopardy of making this thing nag me for two weeks, three weeks, I'll play," he said.
7222afb5-9052-4396-878d-1c761aeb4bdf  — The Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry and the Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry today were named NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for games played Monday, Feb. 22 through Sunday, Feb. 28.

Lowry led the Raptors to a 3-1 week (3-0 in games in which he appeared) behind averages of 28.7 points (first in the Eastern Conference), 8.7 assists (tied-second in the conference) and 6.3 rebounds. Lowry recorded a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists during a 122-95 win against the New York Knicks on Feb. 22. He closed his week by hitting the game-winning shot as part of a 43-point performance in a 99-97 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Feb. 26.

Curry led the Warriors to a 4-0 week behind a league-leading 43.8 points, producing games of 36, 42, 51 and 46 points. He made at least five three-point field goals in each contest, including two games with 10 or more threes, and shot 61.1 percent (33-of-54) from long distance. On Feb. 27, Curry capped his 46-point outing by making the game-winning three-pointer with 0.6 seconds left in overtime as the Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-118. He finished with 12 threes, tying an NBA single-game record.

Here is a recap of the week for Lowry and Curry:

1f99361d-60fa-4466-9c72-6e68ef62854c  — Grizzlies forward-center Brandan Wright is out indefinitely after an MRI exam found a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.

The Grizzlies announced the injury update Monday and said surgery is not required to repair his knee.

Wright left Saturday night's loss in Phoenix with 11:05 left in the third quarter. This was the same knee the 6-foot-10 Wright had surgery on in December after soreness had sidelined him since Nov. 7. Saturday's injury occurred in Wright's fifth game back after his rehab.

Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said the injury was an unfortunate development both for Memphis and Wright.

The forward-center is averaging 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds in 17.7 minutes over 12 games this season.

Memphis plays at Denver on Monday night.

LeBron vs. PG13

There's a lot of history between these two superstar forwards. George and the Pacers have faced LeBron James in the playoffs three times over the last four seasons with LeBron and the Miami Heat winning each series. Now back in Cleveland, the Pacers get to see LeBron at least four times a season as a division rival. So far this season, the Cavaliers are 2-0 against the Pacers with LeBron averaging 26.5 points, 9.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists. George was dominant in his first game against the Cavaliers this season, posting 32 points on 11-for-21 shooting, 11 rebounds and six assists. But his last matchup was a different story as he struggled from the field and finished with just 11 points on 3-for-15 shooting as the Pacers lost in overtime. If George struggles again, Indiana will turn to Monta Ellis, George Hill and rookie Myles Turner.

Looking To Bounce Back

Both teams enter tonight's contest with something to prove. The Cavaliers have lost three of their last four games and were controlled by the Wizards on Sunday as LeBron James took the game off to rest. A return home to Cleveland is exactly what the doctor ordered as the Cavaliers are an Eastern Conference best 24-5 at home this season. A loss would tie the Cavaliers' longest losing streak of the season at three. The Pacers enter on a two-game losing streak of their own after being shut down by the Blazers on Sunday night. Portland shot 50.6 percent from the field and held Paul George to 4-for-15 shooting in 29 minutes. The Pacers will need much more from George tonight if they want to avoid a third straight loss, which would tie their longest losing streak of the season.

Contrasting Styles

It's elite offense versus elite defense in the first of NBA TV's doubleheader. The Cavaliers enter with the fourth best offensive rating and the 29th fastest pace and the Pacers counter with the third best defensive rating and the eighth fastest pace. Keep an eye on turnovers tonight as the Pacers lead the league in points off turnovers with 19.6 per game. So the Cavaliers will need to protect the rock in order to limit a key part of Indiana's offense.

Thunder vs. Kings (10 ET, NBA TV)

Tough Pill To Swallow

Oklahoma City enters tonight's matchup reeling from a heartbreaking defeat at the hands of the champion Golden State Warriors on Saturday. The Thunder controlled for most of the game until Stephen Curry hit the most memorable shot of the season from 35-plus feet out with :00.7 seconds remaining in overtime. The Curry dagger occurred with Kevin Durant on the bench after he fouled out a minute into the overtime period. Prior to fouling out for the first time in three seasons, Durant was dominant (37 points on 13-for-26 shooting, 12 rebounds and five assists). Don't be surprised if Durant, Russell Westbrook and the Thunder are extra motivated for a dominant game in Sacramento tonight after how Saturday's game ended.

Boogie On

DeMarcus Cousins continues to dominate for the Kings with averages of 30.4 points, 13.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.4 steals over his last five games. He's critical to the Kings' success against Oklahoma City as scored 33 points against the Thunder in the Kings' win in January and just 13 points in their loss in December. He's currently battling through a knee injury, but is expected to play tonight after dropping 26 points and 15 rebounds on the Clippers on Friday. The Kings hope their 24th rated defense will be able to handle Durant, Westbrook and the second best offense in the league tonight.

Playoff Standings

Every game matters for the Kings as they sit four games behind Houston for the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference. After tonight's home game, Sacramento hits the road for a daunting four-game trip takes them through the Southwest Division to Memphis, Dallas, San Antonio and New Orleans. A loss tonight and a sub-.500 road trip could signal the end of the Kings' playoff hopes. With this in mind, expect Cousins and the Kings to be extremely motivated against the Thunder tonight. Meanwhile, Oklahoma City is motivated to hold onto the No. 3 spot in the West and avoid a possible West semifinals matchup with the Warriors. The Thunder currently sit 2.5 games ahead of the No. 4 seed Clippers.

0c935361-0f99-455c-b7d1-e7af034d4993  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

597f6c4c-1d96-44ce-8447-b4806189d0b4  — Los Angeles Clippers forward Branden Dawson was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of spousal abuse.

Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera said the 23-year-old player was taken into custody around 7:30 a.m. at a residence in the Playa Vista area, where the team's practice facility is located on the city's westside.

He was released on $50,000 bail about six hours later. Herrera didn't immediately know if Dawson had an attorney.

"It's an awful situation," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "I have a daughter."

Dawson has appeared in two games for the Clippers this season, averaging 1.0 point and 1.5 rebounds. Rivers said it was too early to discuss possible team punishment for him.

Dawson was recalled from the Erie (Pennsylvania) BayHawks of the NBA's D-League on Saturday. He last played for them in a road game in Maine on Thursday night.

After his arrest, he wasn't with the Clippers for Sunday's nationally televised home game against Cleveland.

It was Dawson's fourth D-League assignment and his first in Erie this season. He averaged 19.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.2 steals in six games for the BayHawks. His other D-League stints were in Bakersfield, California, and Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Dawson, of Gary, Indiana, attended Michigan State, where he played four seasons and helped the Spartans reach the Final Four as a senior. He was drafted in the second round by the Clippers last summer.
235e84dd-4a0e-4f37-b09b-9344254830e5  Pacers vs. Hawks (6 ET, NBA TV)

Playoff Implications

Only six games separate the No. 3 seed from the No. 9 seed in the crowded Eastern Conference playoff picture. Atlanta and Indiana are in the middle of the pack as the Hawks hold a 1.5-game lead over the No. 7 seed Pacers. Indiana enters with a 2-1 series lead over Atlanta, so a win tonight would lock up the tie-breaker for the Pacers and move them to within a half game of the No. 6 seed. In their last matchup, the Hawks were powered by Paul Millsap, who scored 24 points in the 102-96 home win. Expect the Hawks to be extremely motivated tonight as they look to build off this performance and extend their lead over Indiana in the standings.

Start Your Engines

The Pacers enter on a three-game win streak after playing some of their best basketball of the season to secure wins over Washington, San Antonio and Dallas. Paul George and Monta Ellis have led the charge for Indiana during this stretch, with rookie Myles Turner also providing steady offensive production. In two games against the Hawks this season, Turner is averaging 16.0 points on 54.0 percent shooting, 6.5 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 24.5 minutes. Indiana will hope to get similar production from Turner tonight as they look to attack the glass against the Hawks, who are the second-worst rebounding team in the league.

Elite Defenses

Both Atlanta and Indiana enter in the top three in defensive rating on the season, with the Hawks at No. 2 and the Pacers at No. 3. The Hawks have played the best defense in the league since Jan. 1 as they allow a remarkable 96.9 points per 100 possessions. Unlike some other teams in the top 10 of defensive rating, both Indiana and Atlanta play their elite defense at a high tempo and respectively rank 9th and 12th in pace. This mix of defense and pace should combine to create an electric game between two teams who know how much a win tonight could affect their playoff seeding a month from now.

a3fb7f0e-0e00-406f-8c0a-3ee232845cd6  — Portland Trail Blazers reserve Ed Davis was ejected with 2:42 remaining in the third quarter of their game against the Orlando Magic for a flagrant foul on Jason Smith.

Davis used both arms to come down hard on Smith as he drove to the basket. Initially called a common foul, officials reviewed the play and upgraded it to a Flagrant 2, which is an automatic ejection. Replays showed Davis' forearm catching Smith across the nose without much of an attempt to play the ball.

Smith got into a verbal exchange earlier in the period with Portland star Damian Lillard. The two were quickly separated by officials.

Portland led 82-60 at the time of the ejection.
c46f96de-2a37-4ce7-af69-a66cd12c824c  — Golden State forward Andre Iguodala will miss at least two weeks due to a sprained left ankle.

Iguodala got hurt in the second half of the league-leading Warriors' 128-112 win against Portland on Friday. He will be re-evaluated in two weeks.

"It's a big deal. It's a really big deal," Kerr said before Saturday's game against Phoenix. "Andre's so important to everything we do. Not only just in terms of schematically, but just emotionally."

The 32-year-old Iguodala was the NBA Finals MVP last year when the Warriors won the title for the first time since 1975. The reserve is averaging 7.3 points and 4.1 rebounds in 60 games this season.

Kerr said he expects reserve forward Brandon Rush will see an increase in minutes. Point guard Ian Clark also could get more time on the court.

"We've got a lot of guys who are really smart players, who understand the game, who know the ebbs and flows, when to calm things down," Kerr said. "We have to get the right combinations out there. But nobody's going to replace Andre. He's the Finals MVP, one of the smartest guys I've ever been around."
ec03ca9d-beac-4d23-bffa-53613ef5d282  — The Minnesota Timberwolves have signed center Greg Smith to a second 10-day contract.

Smith originally was signed to a 10-day contract on March 2. The team announced his second signing Saturday.

Smith has averaged 2.8 points, 2.2 rebounds and 10.7 minutes in six games with the Timberwolves.
e61be1d2-a996-480a-9fa4-7e7e22b43b15  The Memphis Grizzlies today announced that the team has signed guard Ray McCallum and center Alex Stepheson to 10-day contracts pursuant to the NBA's hardship rule.

McCallum (6-3, 190) has appeared in 144 career games (43 starts) with the Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs and averaged 5.9 points, 2.0 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 18.0 minutes during his three-year NBA career. He played 31 games (three starts) for the Spurs this season and recorded 2.2 points, 1.0 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 8.3 minutes before he was waived on Feb. 29.

The 24-year-old has competed in 16 games (all starts) in the NBA Development League with the Reno Bighorns and Austin Spurs and posted 18.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.63 steals in 37.3 minutes. He completed six assignments to Austin this season and averaged 17.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.33 steals in nine contests.

A 2010 McDonald's All-American, McCallum was drafted by Sacramento in the second round (36th overall) of the 2013 NBA Draft following a three-year collegiate career at the University of Detroit Mercy where he played for his father, Titans head coach Ray McCallum, Sr. He was a three-time All-Horizon selection and was named the 2013 Horizon League Player of the Year after averaging 18.7 points, 5.1 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.94 steals in 36.6 minutes in 33 games (all starts) as a junior.

Stepheson (6-10, 270) appeared in 31 games (all starts) for the D-League's Iowa Energy and was named a 2016 D-League All-Star after averaging 15.9 points, a league-high 13.8 rebounds and 1.35 blocks in 34.2 minutes. The D-League leader in double-doubles (26) this season, Stepheson signed with the Los Angeles Clippers to the first of two consecutive 10-day contracts on Feb. 20 and totaled two points, two rebounds and two blocks in 11 minutes over three contests.

Since finishing his collegiate career at the University of Southern California, the 28-year-old has played professionally in Greece, Slovenia and Turkey. During the 2014-15 season, he averaged 12.3 points and a league-leading 9.2 rebounds in 26.8 minutes over 29 games (21 starts) for Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi.

Undrafted in the 2011 NBA Draft, the Los Angeles native made three appearances for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2015 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas and also played three games for the Grizzlies during the 2015 preseason.
99e09d84-1a1b-43e9-815e-9ae7d32a70e1  — Grizzlies guard Mike Conley has Achilles tendinitis in his left foot that will keep him out for at least 3 to 4 weeks, after which he will be re-evaluated.

The Grizzlies provided an update on Conley's injury on Saturday, along with that of center Chris Andersen, who remains out after dislocating his left shoulder March 6 in a loss to Phoenix. The Grizzlies say Andersen will continue to be re-evaluated.

Conley has missed the last three games with soreness in his foot. He started all 56 games he has played this season, averaging 15.3 points and a team-high 6.1 assists.

This is just the latest wave of injuries for the Grizzlies (39-26), who remain fifth in the Western Conference despite a changing lineup. Memphis plays at Atlanta on Saturday night, a night after beating New Orleans in overtime with a rookie point guard signed out of the D-League on a 10-day contract earlier in the day.

Briante Weber was signed after Memphis waived guard Mario Chalmers, who ruptured his right Achilles tendon in a loss at Boston on Wednesday night. Weber scored 10 points and had seven assists in 40 minutes against New Orleans.

The Grizzlies looked for more short-term help on Saturday by signing guard Ray McCallum and center Alex Stepheson to 10-day contracts. The two were active for Saturday night's game in Atlanta.

McCallum played in 31 games, including three starts, for San Antonio this season before being waived on Feb. 29.

The Grizzlies already are without center Marc Gasol, who had season-ending surgery to repair a broken navicular bone in his right foot last month. Zach Randolph has missed three straight games with a sore right knee. Jordan Adams has been out since having surgery on his right knee, and Brandan Wright also is recovering from a sore right knee.
35ef79e1-156d-48cf-9101-052cba274356  The Memphis Grizzlies today announced injury updates for guard Mike Conley and center Chris Andersen.

Conley has missed the last two games with left foot soreness and received an additional examination Friday, which showed Achilles tendonitis. He will remain out and will be re-evaluated in 3 to 4 weeks.

Conley has appeared in 56 games (all starts) this season for the Grizzlies and averaged 15.3 points, 2.9 rebounds, a team-high 6.1 assists and 1.20 steals in 31.4 minutes.

Andersen experienced a left shoulder subluxation and left the game on March 6 vs. Phoenix with 7:59 remaining in the second quarter. Additional examination and an MRI confirmed the injury. He will be listed as out and will continue to be re-evaluated.

Andersen has appeared in nine games (four starts) this season for the Grizzlies and recorded 4.0 points and 4.7 rebounds in 16.9 minutes. He was acquired by Memphis from Miami in a three-team trade (also involving Charlotte) on Feb. 16.
c64d8475-de21-47a4-bda0-29249eddd307  There's nothing a little motivation to you get going, right?

That seems to be the case with a certain 7-foot German, who after tumbling to his lowest standing on the OSPR, has rebounded in a big way.

The middle of the list, meanwhile, remains relatively unchanged, while two names return to the season-long chase and a fivesome is itching to make the cut.

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 10. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 3 games, 20.3 ppg, 15.3 rpg, 7.7 apg

Season stats: 17.1 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 4.0 apg

We're beginning to sound like a broken record when it comes to Mr. Do It All, who again filled the stat sheet with some impressive numbers. In addition to the above stats, Gasol also managed 3.0 blocks and has two triple-doubles in his last six games. But if we're going to nitpick, the 16 turnovers in three games is hard to overlook.

Arena Link: Pau Gasol Pau Gasol joins GameTime via arena link after notching a triple-double in a victory over Milwaukee.

2. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 3 games, 20.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 19.3 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg

Despite shooting just 40 percent from the field last week, Wade has now gone nine straight games with at least 16 points. He's also managed 20 or more in three of the last four. Wade also got defensive last week, snatching seven steals. It's the first time since Jan. 26-31 he's gone three straight games with two or more steals.

3. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: 3 games, 25.7 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 18.0 ppg, 6.6 apg, 1.7 apg

Take that, OSPR. After slipping all the way to No. 5, Nowitzki turned things around quickly with three impressive games in which he shot 55.6 from the field, 43.8 from beyond the arc (7-for-16) and 90.9 from the free-throw line (10-for-11). For good measure, Nowitzki secured his first double-digit rebound game since Feb. 26.

Nowitzki's Big Night See highlights from Dirk Nowitzki's 30 point night against the Nuggets.

4. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 12.0 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 13.9 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.1 apg

After a five-point outing last Saturday on 2-for-7 shooting, Crawford rebounded decently with two games of 15 or more points. But it was still a tough shooting week for Crawford, who went just 38.2 from the field and would have slipped a notch if Randolph hadn't missed a couple games with injury.

5. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 2 games, 15.5 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 apg

Randolph, who missed two games with a sore knee, managed one solid performance in the two he did play, going for 25 and eight in a win over the Jazz. But he followed that up two nights later with six points (3-for-10 shooting) and eight rebounds. That showing ended a string of 14 consecutive games with double-figure scoring.

6. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 3 games, 12.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.3 apg

Season stats: 11.9 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.9 apg

It was another uneventful week for Johnson, who didn't break loose offensively despite 53.6 FG% and 66.7 3PT%. That tends to happen when you take just 27 FGA in three games combined. In fact, Johnson has managed 10 or more FGA in just two of his last five. For the season, Johnson has taken 15 or more FGA in a game just eight times.

7. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 9.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 8.0 apg

Season stats: 12.4 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.2 apg

Parker kept his position on the strength of Thursday's 20-point, 12-assist showing, which was his first double-double since Dec. 16. Outside of that game, it was a forgettable week for Parker, who went for a combined eight points on 3-for-14 shooting in his other two games. At least he's gone for five or more assists in four straight.

8. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: NA

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.5 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 0.3 apg

Season stats: 6.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

What happens when you get two double-doubles in four games on 59.3 shooting from the field? You get back on the list for the first time since Week 11. Heck, it might have been a perfect 4-for-4 had Chandler managed more than four FGA in two of those games.

9. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 9

Last week's stats: 2 games, 19.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg

Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 3.2 apg

Like Parker, Bryant maintained his spot on the list thanks to Thursday's 26-point performance (11-for-16 FGA, 3-for-4 on 3-pointers) against the Cavaliers. It was one of his stronger games all season, and his highest scoring output since going for 27 on Feb. 4 against the Pelicans (and he needed 24 shots that night).

Last week's stats: 4 games, 11.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.5 apg

Season stats: 5.7 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 0.8 apg

With the Grizzlies looking like a MASH unit these days, Carter's number is being called more often (24.2 minutes last week). He's answering the call, scoring 15 or more points (on just 18 combined FGA) in back-to-back games to go along with 47.1 (8-for-17) from beyond the arc. He also chipped in 1.8 steals for the week.

e4dc025f-9ce1-45f7-bc37-1921d782f723  — Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and his wife, Shelly Sterling, have decided to remain in their six-decade marriage.

The Sterlings are opting out of the divorce that Donald Sterling filed for in August just two weeks before their 60th anniversary, according to a filing this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The move is the latest twist in the long, strange saga of the Sterlings, who ended up selling the Clippers for $2 billion to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in the aftermath of racist comments Donald Sterling made on a recording to a friend that saw him banned from the NBA.

Donald Sterling, 81, cited irreconcilable differences in his divorce filings last year and said the couple had been separated since 2012.

"Notwithstanding all the difficult events of the last two years, the Sterlings have resolved their differences," Donald Sterling's attorney, Bobby Samini, wrote in an email Friday to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported on the couple's reconciliation.

Pierce O'Donnell, Shelly Sterling's attorney, did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

In 2014, a recording of Donald Sterling telling friend V. Stiviano not to associate with black people led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. The recording was leaked weeks after Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, alleging she was her husband's mistress.

Donald Sterling gave caustic, combative testimony during a 2014 trial over the team's sale, saying Shelly Sterling duped him. He called her a "pig" when she tried to approach him after her testimony.

Yet the couple testified at trial last year about their enduring love for each other, displaying cards they gave each other for anniversaries and birthdays.
57be86bf-a375-4978-a0e2-299615a81bb1  The U.S. will open the Olympics against China and also will face Venezuela and Australia after being drawn Friday into what appears to be the easier men's basketball group.

The Americans will be in Group A, which will also include two teams that will be determined after three qualifying tournaments in July.

Group B includes Spain, Argentina, Lithuania, host Brazil, Nigeria and the remaining July qualifier.

The U.S., which has won the last two Olympic gold medals, is the No. 1-ranked country in the world. Spain, Lithuania and Argentina are Nos. 2-4 and Brazil is ninth.

Australia, China and Venezuela, which qualified by winning their regional zone championships, are all outside the top 10.

But the July tournaments feature strong teams such as France, Serbia and Greece, so the Americans could end up with two more strong opponents. The three six-team tournaments will be held from July 4-10, giving the winners an early start on having their teams ready for Rio.

"So we know that they'll not only be excellent teams, but they will already be on a roll when they get to the Olympics," U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said in a statement.

"We know that repeating as gold medalists at the 2016 Olympics will be a challenge, and that's what makes winning a gold medal such an amazing accomplishment."

The draw was conducted in Mies, Switzerland, at the headquarters of FIBA, basketball's world governing body.

The Olympic competition opens Aug. 6 and the top four teams in each pool advance to the quarterfinals.
781bb80f-ff4a-4f16-8149-d0949e7695c9  — Bulls star Derrick Rose sat out Friday's game against Miami because of a strained left groin, while Dwyane Wade was in the Heat's lineup after a bruised right thigh put his status in question.

Wade suited up against Chicago after he was hurt in Wednesday's loss at Milwaukee.

The Bulls, meanwhile, were without their starting backcourt with Rose and Jimmy Butler (strained left knee) remaining sidelined.

Rose's groin started bothering him during Thursday's loss at San Antonio, and his plan "for right now" is to play Monday at Toronto.

Butler visited Dr. James Andrews on Thursday and worked out on Friday. The Bulls hope to have him back Monday.

Chicago had E'Twaun Moore starting at point guard and Justin Holiday at shooting guard on Friday.
762166c1-3fa0-404f-b68a-3b66250d36f5  — Philadelphia 76ers rookie center Jahlil Okafor will have season-ending surgery on his right knee.

The team said Friday it will soon announce when he will have surgery for the small cartilage tear. He is expected to resume basketball activities in about six weeks.

Okafor, the No. 3 overall pick of the 2015 draft, leads the NBA-worst Sixers with 17.5 points and averaged 7.0 rebounds in 53 games.

"When you study what's going on, it's only going to be a 10-minute procedure," Sixers head coach Brett Brown said before Friday night's game against Brooklyn. "It's going to restrict him from playing for six weeks. Because of the timing, it sounds more dramatic than it should. The impact it has on someone moving forward is negligible."

Okafor has not played since he was hit hard in the shin on his right leg during the Feb. 28 game against Orlando. The rookie also missed two games in December with soreness in the same knee.

Okafor said he noticed that his "knee just didn't feel right" while recently rehabbing his separate shin injury on the treadmill, before alerting the team's medical staff.

"It's just kind of a sigh of relief because I was able to know exactly what was going on with my knee and that it's something minor," Okafor said. "It was good to finally know what was going on."

Okafor had been one of the NBA's top rookies, showcasing the polished offensive post game that helped him lead Duke to last year's national championship. But his season has also been marred by off-court trouble and he served a two-game suspension for his role in a Boston street fight.

Brown, though, insists that the 20-year-old big man has matured both on and off the court as the season has progressed.

"You step back and say he had a heck of NBA season, he really did," the Sixers coach said. "His mood is great. He's disappointed obviously but he must take pride in the fact that he had a good NBA year coming in at 19 and to go through all the things he did. I'm proud of him. He's a good person and he cares, and I think his season should be remembered like that."

The Sixers have lost 13 straight entering Friday night's game against Brooklyn.
f6bcec7f-e5f8-402d-85e2-5af6d7e2600d  — The Oklahoma City Thunder announced today that assistant coach Monty Williams will not return to the team this season after the passing of his wife Ingrid last month.

Oklahoma City Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti:

"The most important thing for Monty during this time is for him to be with his family, and the most important thing for us as an organization is to support him as a person, in any way that we can. Even though Monty will not return to the team this season, his presence will be felt by all of us within the program and we will remain close with him and his family."

Oklahoma City Thunder Head Coach Billy Donovan:

"I have really enjoyed my relationship with Monty, and clearly we will miss him, but we value and embrace that it is critical he is there for his family at this time and our focus is on doing whatever we can, in any small way, to help him. He and his family will continue to be in our thoughts."
d3ab8014-3cdc-4e9f-8f83-8397f711667e  — The following is a statement from Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Sam Hinkie, regarding Jahlil Okafor:

"Jahlil recently started to experience discomfort in his right knee, which we immediately investigated. After a comprehensive series of tests and additional evaluation by our medical team, it was revealed that he has a small tear of the meniscus. Jahlil will undergo a minor arthroscopic procedure to address the injury. Timing and details of the procedure will be finalized in the coming days.

"Our medical team will continually monitor and evaluate Jahlil's progress, and we anticipate he will resume full basketball activities in approximately six weeks."
9a18e5c3-0d4c-4f62-9a6d-fdc639ab9740  — While Chris Bosh hopes to return this season, the Miami Heat aren't ready to put a timetable on their star forward's comeback.

One day after the 11-time All-Star released a statement saying he would love to rejoin the team's playoff push after his latest blood clot scare, coach Erik Spoelstra would not say when Bosh will suit up again.

As long as he is getting better, that's what matters. – Heat's Luol Deng on Chris Bosh

All Spoelstra would say after Friday's shootaround in Chicago before a game against the Bulls was that Bosh "is in a great place right now" as he tries to work his way back.

As for a return?

"We don't have any kind of timetable or anything like that," Spoelstra said.

The Heat came into Friday's game fourth in the Eastern Conference at 37-27, and they sure would not mind getting Bosh back for a playoff run.

Skolnick Update On Bosh Ethan Skolnick of the Miami Herald checks in with 10 Before Tip for the latest on Chris Bosh's health and his possible return.

He isn't their only banged up star at the moment. Dwyane Wade has been nursing a bruised thigh.

Bosh has not since Feb. 9, when he scored 18 in a loss to San Antonio. Bosh said in his statement Thursday he does not currently have deep vein thrombosis - or blood clots in his leg. He did not mention if he was still on blood thinners and, like Spoelstra, did not set a timetable for his comeback.

Even so, it was the first time since Feb. 13, the day after he withdrew from the All-Star game with what was described as a strained left calf, that he said anything even close to specific about his status. And while questions linger, so do concerns.

"As a friend, you want to see him healthy," Miami's Luol Deng said. "Basketball is just what we do. We all love to play basketball, but people forget that we have lives. He has a great family. All your teammates and all your friends, the biggest thing is their health. As long as he is getting better, that's what matters."

Goran Dragic echoed that, saying, "We need him. But his health comes first."

Bosh has been going through individual workouts with the coaches, training, watching game video, walking through plays and attending home games. One thing he isn't doing is traveling. But teammates and Spoelstra see the effort he is putting in and would no doubt love to have him back in the lineup, helping the Heat make a playoff push and maybe even challenge old friend LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers for supremacy in the Eastern Conference.

"We're very happy that he's around, that he's healthy, that his spirits are good," Spoelstra said. "We love him. I love his spirit and him being around the team."

They're doing just fine for now without Bosh, who was averaging 19.1 points per game before being sidelined.

The Heat had won eight of 11 without him heading into Friday's game while playing at a faster pace with newcomer Joe Johnson starting at small forward and Deng moving from there to Bosh's spot at power forward.

While the Heat hope to get Bosh back, they are also steeling themselves for the possibility he does not return this season.

"First of all, we need to take care of business now," Dragic said. "We need to think about the games we're playing. It's really hard to think about the future. You never know what the future holds. But we're going to be happy (if) he's going to come back and I think that's gonna be good for our team."
49d78a91-9e84-4950-8af7-d126541e81fa  Heat vs. Bulls (8 ET, NBA TV)

Playoff Implications

Miami, the fourth seed, and Chicago, the ninth seed, are separated by just 4½ games in the crowded Eastern Conference playoff picture. The fourth seed, with homecourt advantage in the first round, is a realistic goal for both teams, while landing the eighth seed -- with a likely matchup against the No. 1 seed Cleveland Cavaliers -- is the worst-case scenario (outside of missing the playoffs). Miami was riding a six-game win streak before falling to the Bucks in Milwaukee on Wednesday. Since the All-Star break, the Heat have the fifth best defensive rating in the NBA. The Heat lead the season series with Chicago 2-0, with the final matchup coming on April 7 in Miami.

Banged-Up Bulls

It hasn't been a good 2016 for the Bulls so far. Jimmy Butler (knee), Nikola Mirotic (appendicitis) and Joakim Noah (shoulder) have missed significant time and are still out of the lineup, while Derrick Rose (hamstring) has missed games but is back on the court. This season, the Bulls are 5-9 with Butler out of the lineup. Pau Gasol has stepped up during this stretch, with two triple-doubles over his last six games with the most recent coming against the Bucks on Monday (12 points, 17 rebounds, 13 assists). As well, Derrick Rose is playing better of late, averaging 21.4 points, 5.6 assists and shooting 53.1 percent since the All-Star break. The Bulls will need another big game from Gasol (and Rose) tonight if they hope to win and get back in the playoff chase.

'Hassanity' Off The Bench

Hassan Whiteside has been on a tear since coach Erik Spoelstra moved him to the bench on February 3. The Heat are 10-5 over this span with Whiteside averaging 16.4 points on 60.3 percent shooting, 13.2 rebounds and an NBA-leading 4.1 blocks in only 28.4 minutes. His move to the bench has allowed the Heat to play at a faster pace as Whiteside plays alongside versatile forwards like Luol Deng and Justise Winslow instead of slower veterans like Amar'e Stoudemire and Joe Johnson. Stoudemire, who is the new starting center, has shown flashes of his old self as he brings a needed offensive tenacity to the Heat's frontline that has been missing since Chris Bosh went down due to illness. Watch tonight to see how Whiteside matches up against the Bulls' bench bigs.

Knicks vs. Clippers (10:30 ET, NBA TV)

Sharp Shooters

They don't get the hype of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in Golden State, but Chris Paul and J.J. Redick are almost as proficient from deep as the "Splash Brothers." Our own John Schuhmann dug into this fact two weeks ago, highlighting the backcourt's high percentages from everywhere on the court. This hot shooting has continued for the Clippers' backcourt, allowing them to hold a 3½ game lead over the Grizzlies for the No. 4 seed in the West. It hasn't been all offense for the Clippers, though. Since Blake Griffin went down due to injury on Dec. 25, the Clippers have the third-best defensive rating in the NBA (behind only Atlanta and San Antonio). Let's see if that defense comes to play tonight against a struggling Knicks' offense.

Searching For Answers

After a promising start to 2015-16, the Knicks have come back down to earth and are now looking for some semblance of direction over the final month of the season. New York has lost 17 of its last 22 games with its last win streak occurring in mid-January. A win tonight in Los Angeles would give them two straight wins after they scored a season-high 128 points in defeating the woeful Suns on Wednesday. Carmelo Anthony scored 23 points in the win for his sixth straight game of 20 or more points. Will 'Melo and the Knicks be able to replicate this dominant performance tonight against an elite Clippers' defense?

Eyes On OKC

The top three teams in the Western Conference have been Golden State, San Antonio and Oklahoma City for the majority of the season. But quietly, the Clippers are gaining ground on the Thunder for that No. 3 spot and sit only 2½ games back from Oklahoma City. Whoever lands in the No. 3 spot is rewarded with not having to likely face the Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals. The Spurs are no consolation prize, but the Clippers have some experience eliminating San Antonio in the postseason. As the impact of each game matters more in the season's final month, expect the Clippers to play focused against the struggling Knicks.

188971b2-66a8-472d-b382-e5233d56206f  — Kevin Love has been scratched from the Cleveland Cavaliers' lineup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night because of discomfort and swelling in his knees.

The eight-year veteran and three-time All-Star, whose four-point play with 1:32 remaining helped beat the Sacramento Kings 120-111 the night before, sat out for the third time in his second season with the Cavaliers. Love is averaging 15.8 points and 10.0 rebounds.

Channing Frye started in place of Love.

Love had 17 points and 10 rebounds in Sacramento on Wednesday.
57f2786b-570f-4299-a9e2-61488ed0d708  — Grizzlies guard Mario Chalmers will miss the rest of the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon, and Memphis waived the veteran to clear up a much-needed spot on the roster.

The Grizzlies announced both the severity of Chalmers' injury and the roster move Thursday night.

"He has been an important part of our success this season, both coming off the bench and when called upon as a starter," general manager Chris Wallace said in a statement posted on the team website. "But with Mario's season-ending injury and our already depleted roster, it became necessary to free up a roster spot."

Chalmers was hurt with 6:57 left in the third quarter Wednesday night in Boston with the Grizzlies down 64-61 in what wound up a 116-96 loss. He was taken out of the locker room in a wheelchair.

The Grizzlies (38-26) ranked fifth in the Western Conference on Thursday, but the injuries are really starting to add up. Memphis, which hosts New Orleans on Friday night, is expected to use injury exceptions to add help to the roster.

Center Marc Gasol had season-ending surgery to repair a broken navicular bone in his right foot last month. Starting point guard Mike Conley has missed the last two games with a sore right foot, Zach Randolph has been out with a sore right knee in those games, and Chris Andersen -- Gasol's replacement, has been out since dislocating his left shoulder last Sunday.

Jordan Adams has been out since having surgery on his right knee, and Brandan Wright also is recovering from a sore right knee after returning from surgery on the same knee earlier this season.

That left the Grizzlies without seven players and four starters Monday night when they won at Cleveland.

Memphis acquired Chalmers on Nov. 10 from Miami, and he has averaged 10.8 points and 3.8 assists in 55 games with the Grizzlies. He was even better in his seven starts, helping Memphis go 5-2 in those games. He scored 17 points in that win at Cleveland.
353d13c8-9498-44d9-83ac-afd5d60b5335  — The Milwaukee Bucks have lost guard O.J. Mayo for the rest of the season after he broke his right ankle Thursday morning going down a set of stairs at his home.

General manager John Hammond said Mayo fractured his ankle after he "accidentally tripped descending his stairs."

Mayo averaged 7.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.17 steals in 26.6 minutes during 41 games this season for the Bucks, who are last in the Central Division with a record of 27-38.
557f3665-f398-4961-a0d5-fb80d8e46e0a  — The Chicago Bulls got the news they anticipated after orthopedist Dr. James Andrews found no structural damage in All-Star guard Jimmy Butler's injured left knee.

Butler was examined Thursday in Pensacola, Florida.

The team says Andrews "gave a confirmatory opinion and supports the current management of Butler's condition." He was scheduled to work out Thursday but sit out the game at San Antonio.

The Bulls placed no timetable on his return.

Butler sat out Monday's win over Milwaukee because of swelling in the same knee that had sidelined him for 11 games. He had returned to score 24 points while playing 34 minutes in Saturday's win over Houston but experienced stiffness in his back the following day. He then developed swelling in his knee on Monday.

Washington will join the eight other teams in the league. The team does not yet have a name.

f81bac91-d9f9-4fb6-ac40-aaad642e5dec  — The Sacramento Kings have suspended center DeMarcus Cousins for one game for "conduct detrimental to the team."

Vlade Divac, the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager, announced the disciplinary action Thursday. The Kings said Cousins would sit out Friday's home game against the Orlando Magic.

While the Kings offered no other details about Cousins' conduct, video from Sacramento's 120-111 home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday showed Cousins sitting on the bench and in the huddle yelling and heatedly gesturing with his arm at coach George Karl, who was only a couple of feet away.

Divac was seen speaking after the game outside the locker room with Cousins, who scored 29 points and 11 rebounds in the loss. Cousins and Karl have been at odds previously.

Butler will resume workouts today, be monitored and will return to play when appropriate.

ca532315-de66-4625-8137-e2ca412a0962  A demotion to the bench is the last thing most players want to happen the season before they enter free agency.

But for Hassan Whiteside, the move out of the Heat's starting lineup and to the bench has sparked dominance.

Since being moved to the bench on February 3, the Heat are 10-5 with Whiteside averaging 16.4 points on 60.3 percent shooting, 13.2 rebounds and an NBA-leading 4.1 blocks in only 28.4 minutes. Per 36 minutes, Whiteside is averaging an unmatched 20.7 points, 16.7 rebounds and 5.2 blocks.

The disgruntled Whiteside from earlier in the season appears to be gone as he thrives alongside versatile players like Luol Deng, Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson. The switch to the bench has allowed the Heat to pick up the pace with Whiteside when their veterans (aka Dwyane Wade, Amar'e Stoudemire and Joe Johnson) are off the floor. He's feasting on opposing bench bigs and providing a necessary spark for Miami's veteran group.

GameTime: Hassan Whiteside The Game Time crew discuss why they think Hassan Whiteside has been so successful lately.

The return of Chris Bosh could complicate this bench role for Whiteside. But until Bosh returns (which isn't a guarantee), it's likely coach Erik Spoelstra will keep Whiteside in his current position for as long as the Heat continue to rack up wins. That's good news for his fantasy owners who expect big production from Whiteside with Yahoo! fantasy playoffs starting next week for some leagues.

JaMychal Green, Grizzlies (25 percent owned)

The Memphis big man has stepped up as the Grizzlies continue to deal with countless injuries in their frontcourt. Over his last three games, Green is averaging 16.7 points on 53.1 percent shooting, 9.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 blocks in 32.4 minutes. If he's available in your league, scoop him up. He will be worth rostering for as long as the Grizzlies remain banged up. Memphis matches up with New Orleans on Friday and Atlanta on Saturday.

Mike Dunleavy, Bulls (15 percent owned)

The veteran is starting to find his groove after missing most of the season with a back injury. Over his last two games, Dunleavy is averaging 15.0 points on 68.8 percent shooting, 3.0 3-pointers, 4.0 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 32.2 minutes. He's worth an add if you need points and 3-pointers, especially if Jimmy Butler (knee) remains sidelined. The Bulls matchup with Miami on Friday.

Ronnie Price, Suns (9 percent owned)

Price has been solid for Phoenix over the last three games with averages of 12.0 points on 53.8 percent shooting, 2.7 3-pointers, 4.0 assists, 2.7 rebounds and 2.3 steals in 38.2 minutes. His minutes should remain high, allowing him to provide ample 3-pointers and steals this weekend. The Suns matchup with Golden State on Saturday.

1fb1fea0-9f34-46ad-a857-0c3e4da63660  — Derek Fisher says his altercation with forward Matt Barnes had nothing to do with his firing as New York Knicks coach.

Fisher wrote Thursday in a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated's The Cauldron that the Knicks never mentioned his personal life or that players had lost confidence in him because of it when they fired him in January after 1 1/2 years.

"Nothing remotely like that was ever brought up or discussed," Fisher wrote.

Knicks President of Basketball Operations Phil Jackson, who hired Fisher as coach shortly after his former point guard ended his playing career, had said the incident was an embarrassment but wasn't a consideration in the firing.

But Fisher said stories afterward claimed otherwise, which led him to write the piece that amounted to his first comments beyond a brief statement after his firing.

"That's why I was shocked when stories like that surfaced in the media," he wrote. "So were my players. At the time, we were going through a difficult 1-9 stretch, but to its credit, the entire team was still responsive to my leadership, decision making and coaching. They hadn't given up on me. They weren't questioning my integrity. My relationships with my players were good and becoming stronger."

The altercation with Barnes, now with the Memphis Grizzlies, took place in California in October when Fisher was at the home of Gloria Govan, Barnes' estranged wife. Barnes learned Fisher was there and showed up to confront him.

In the article titled "Truth ," Fisher says he didn't retaliate when Barnes started throwing punches and there was no fight, and that his relationship with Govan wasn't a secret from Barnes.

Barnes and Fisher were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2010-12, but Fisher says they were never friends.

"When Gloria and I started dating, she and Matt had already been separated and living apart for more than a year," Fisher wrote. "Same thing for me. My wife and I were long separated; she was in L.A., I was in New York. Matt and Gloria were not trying to work things out, and I certainly wasn't seeing her behind Matt's back or in secret. The relationship wasn't something I was trying to publicize, but it also wasn't something I was trying to hide, either. There was no reason to."

Fisher missed a preseason practice after traveling to California, with the Knicks saying his return was delayed because of travel issues. It was soon reported that the altercation had taken place.

"At the time, I had no intention of saying anything about what happened, and I definitely didn't wish for the incident to become public knowledge," Fisher said. "As far as I was concerned, it was something I was willing to let pass, and as an NBA head coach, I was more than aware that actions off the court might reflect upon many others beyond just me.

"Then suddenly, the story of a `fight' leaked to the media. I'll let you speculate on who leaked it and why, and the nature of their character. My reputation speaks for itself."
35c57e60-250f-409b-94d1-08854b6dabb6  — Chris Bosh's latest blood-clot scare is over. His quest to rejoin the Miami Heat playoff push is not.

Bosh released a statement Thursday announcing he does not currently have deep vein thrombosis - or blood clots in his leg - and that he remains hopeful of getting back on the court with the Heat at some point this season.

Bosh did not offer any potential timetables for his return. It's the first time he has said anything remotely specific about his status since Feb. 13, the day after he withdrew from the All-Star Game with what was described as a strained left calf.

"I know there have been many questions regarding my health and when I will play again," Bosh said. "My situation this year has never been life threatening. I am feeling great and currently I do not have deep vein thrombosis."

Bosh's statement did not say if he was still on bloodthinners. A person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press last month that Bosh had started taking them to combat this clot, which was described as relatively small. The clot found last month was not in any way as severe as the situation Bosh faced last year, when a clot traveled from his calf to his lung and led to him dealing with severe pain and being hospitalized for several days.

"Together with the Miami Heat, I am working with doctors, exploring the best precautionary treatment options and taking every necessary step to make sure I am healthy for myself, my family and my team," Bosh said. "I have been working out, training with the team, watching film of the games, walking through plays, and have attended home games despite not being visible to the public."

Bosh has given some hints about his condition through tweets in recent days, saying he's "feeling good! feeling great!" on Saturday and an image of two pairs of sneakers on Wednesday with the caption "another day at the office in the books."

I remain positive that I will be able to return this season. – Heat's Chris Bosh in statement

Miami is 8-3 since the All-Star break, the fourth-best record in the NBA over that span, all without Bosh. The Heat have been playing faster in Bosh's absence, and added Joe Johnson late last month - immediately putting him in the starting lineup at small forward, after shifting Luol Deng from that spot to one where he starts in Bosh's position, power forward.

"You can't replace Chris," Heat guard Dwyane Wade said earlier this week. "And we're not trying to replace Chris."

The Heat play in Chicago on Friday. They were off on Thursday, with no practice or availability scheduled.

If Bosh is deemed to be susceptible to blood clots -- a test he took last year suggested that he was not -- it could obviously be a career-threatening issue. Clots are often treated with bloodthinning medications, and athletes who are involved with contact sports are typically advised to avoid using such medication because of the heightened chance of bleeding.

However, Bosh is still planning on being back. He was selected to his 11th All-Star team this year, and was averaging 19.1 points per game before being sidelined.

"I will continue to support my teammates in every way possible," Bosh said. "I remain positive that I will be able to return this season. I truly appreciate everyone's concern and support."

Bosh signed a five-year, $118 million deal in the summer of 2014. He's slotted to make nearly $76 million over the next three seasons.
4371d205-de55-476a-9084-0a355651ca73  — Clyde Lovellette, the Hall of Fame forward who led Kansas to the 1952 national championship before helping the U.S. win gold at the Helsinki Olympics, died Wednesday after a battle with cancer. He was 86.

Lovellette's family said he died at his home in North Manchester, Indiana.

A two-time All-American, Lovellette had 33 points and 17 rebounds in the Phog Allen-coached Jayhawks' victory over St. John's in the NCAA title game. The performance helped him earn tournament MVP honors.

The 6-foot-10 Lovellette led the nation in scoring as a senior with a 28.4 average. He's fourth on Kansas' career scoring list with 1,979 points and 10th in rebounding with 813.

Lovellette spent the 1952-53 season with the AAU's Phillips 66ers and went on to play 11 seasons in the NBA, averaging 17.0 points and 9.5 rebounds in 704 regular-season games with Minneapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Boston. The four-time All-Star helped Minneapolis win the NBA title as a rookie in 1954 and was on Boston's championship teams in 1963 and 1964 in his last two seasons in the league.

"Clyde's passing is a big loss for anyone who has ever supported Kansas athletics," Kansas coach Bill Self said. "He was a great player, a national champion and Olympic gold medalist. He was a beloved teammate and a great ambassador for his alma mater. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."

From Terre Haute, Indiana, Lovellette was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988 and the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012.
680f19f8-8e4a-490d-ac50-a0f83611b4ed  — Memphis guard Mario Chalmers left the Grizzlies' 116-96 loss to the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night after injuring his right leg.

There did not appear to be any contact on the play midway through the third quarter. Chalmers needed help to leave the court, unable to put any weight on his right leg.

Chalmers was averaging 10.8 points and 3.8 assists for Memphis, mostly as a backup for Mike Conley. Conley has missed the last two games with a sore left foot.

The Grizzlies were also without center Marc Gasol, who will miss the rest of the season with a broken right foot, and Zach Randolph (sore right knee).
44b5210c-df66-4e8c-bacd-e28ee9c7b8a0  — San Antonio Spurs CEO and chairman Peter Holt, whose selfless ownership is credited with helping the team win five NBA championships, is retiring after 20 years running one of sports' elite franchises.

He will be replaced as CEO by his wife, Julianna and, at her request, Spurs president of business operations Rick Pych. The team said Wednesday that Peter Holt will remain on the team's board of managers, but his wife will take over his role on the NBA's Board of Governors. Peter Holt has served as chairman of that board.

Holt first joined the Spurs as a minority owner in 1993, but was named CEO and chairman in 1996 after becoming team's largest shareholder. In two decades at the helm, Holt forged a reputation as the gold standard in sports ownership for his willingness to support the franchise financially while also giving those he empowered - coach Gregg Popovich and GM R.C. Buford - the space to make their own decisions.

And in the Spurs' typically understated fashion, the surprising announcement came late Wednesday evening on an off day for the team.

"I'm proud of what we've achieved over the last two decades," said Holt, whose family owns Holt Cat machine and equipment company. "The championships are wonderful, bringing new sports franchises to San Antonio is important but the biggest accomplishment for me will always be the impact we've had in our community. The pride, support and love that our city has for the Spurs is truly amazing."

It was under Holt's guidance that the Spurs hired Popovich as general manager in 1994. Popovich became the team's coach on Dec. 10, 1996, and has led San Antonio to five championships and 19 straight postseason appearances, including a berth this season with the league's second-best record at 54-10.

"For 20 years the Spurs have been a model franchise under Peter Holt, winning five NBA championships and becoming an anchor of the San Antonio community along with building a global following," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. "Peter not only provided steady leadership as an NBA, WNBA and NBA Development League owner but also distinguished himself as Chairman of the NBA Board of Governors and Chairman of the NBA's Labor Relations Committee. We thank him for his outstanding service and look forward to working with Julianna Hawn Holt in her new role as the team's Governor."

Golden State coach Steve Kerr was surprised by the news about his former franchise when he arrived at Oracle Arena on Wednesday to face Utah.

"Wow, that will take a little time to process," Kerr said. "All I can say is that playing for the Spurs, Peter was just an incredible owner, passionate and involved without being overbearing. The perfect combination. It's important to have that kind of leadership. ... One of the reasons the Spurs have been the Spurs, everyone rightfully points to Pop and Tim Duncan, David Robinson. But it takes great ownership, and Peter Holt has been as good as there is."

Popovich has long credited Holt for the team's success, saying the San Antonio native's low-key approach has allowed him and Spurs general manager R.C. Buford to succeed in an era when other owners' impatience has led to constant changes in coaching and direction.

"Peter Holt is smart enough to know he's not a basketball coach or a manager," Popovich said during the 2014 NBA Finals. "He's great at what he does and he's secure enough in his own skin to allow R.C. and I to do our work."
ca3a21fa-d265-4922-b70e-a33ae5afbc3b  — Spurs Sports & Entertainment today announced that Peter M. Holt has retired as the organization's Chairman and CEO and that Julianna Hawn Holt will assume both roles. Peter has held the position since 1996 when the Holts became the largest shareholder in San Antonio Spurs, LLC. Peter will remain on the organization's board of managers and continue as part of the ownership group while Julianna will become the team's Governor on the NBA's Board of Governors.

"I'm proud of what we've achieved over the last two decades," said Peter Holt. "The championships are wonderful, bringing new sports franchises to San Antonio is important but the biggest accomplishment for me will always be the impact we've had in our community. The pride, support and love that our city has for the Spurs is truly amazing."

Under the Holts' leadership, the team has become one of the premier franchises in North American sports. The Spurs have captured five NBA titles (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014) while qualifying for the playoffs 19 straight seasons. The 2015-16 Spurs have a 54-10 record, the best mark to start a season in franchise history, and are a perfect 30-0 at home, which is the third best home record to start a season in NBA history.

"Our ownership in the Spurs has always been a family affair," said Julianna Hawn Holt. "For many years I've had the desire to take a more active role with Spurs Sports & Entertainment. We felt this was the right time to make this transition. We are very excited about the current Spurs season and the future of the organization."

Spurs Sports & Entertainment owns five sports franchises, the San Antonio Spurs, the San Antonio Rampage (AHL), the San Antonio Stars (WNBA), San Antonio FC (USL) and the Austin Spurs (NBA Development League). In addition, SS&E manages the day-to-day operations of the AT&T Center and Toyota Field. Under the Holts' watch, the organization has grown to over 350 full-time and almost 1,000 part-time employees.

"We've been fortunate to have a wonderful ownership group for the last two decades," said Rick Pych, president of business operations for SS&E. "Peter has provided great leadership. His dedication, vision and management style have allowed all of us to develop, grow and succeed. We thank him for his service to the Spurs and the San Antonio community. All of us are excited about the future of SS&E under the guidance and leadership of Julianna."

The board of managers of San Antonio Spurs, LLC, per the request of Julianna, has appointed Pych as co-CEO.
1c53c3e2-8401-4c49-bb93-57eb69a1c8fb  — Thunder guard Dion Waiters' younger brother has died, and Waiters has left the team to be with family.

Demetrius Pinckney was killed Tuesday in Philadelphia, and Waiters will not play Wednesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers.

Thunder general manager Sam Presti said Waiters and his family "are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time." Thunder forward Kevin Durant said it is "tough for anyone to go through that."

It was the third tragedy the Thunder have dealt with this season. Assistant coach Monty Williams' wife, Ingrid, was killed last month in a car crash in Oklahoma City, and part-owner Aubrey McClendon died last week in a one-car accident in Oklahoma City.

Waiters is averaging 12.2 points as a reserve.
defdba6b-0cb7-4b9d-bd6b-13715f7ba1a7  — The Cavaliers have signed guard Jordan McRae for the remainder of this season.

The team said Wednesday that they have signed McRae to a multi-year contract, but provided no further details on his deal. McRae has appeared in three games since he signed a 10-day contract on Feb. 28.

The 6-foot-6 McRae began the season in the NBA Development League, where he made 29l starts for Delaware, averaging 23.3 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists. Against Canton on Jan. 26, he scored a D-League record 61 points with 11 rebounds and seven assists.

McRae also had two 10-day stints with the Phoenix Suns this season, appearing in seven games. He averaged 5.3 points and 1.4 assists in 11.7 minutes.

He was originally selected by San Antonio in the 2014 draft. McRae played in Australia for a year before joining Delaware for the season's final 13 games.
7b330c72-446d-4cd0-975d-1df9fbf33e49  — The Washington Wizards have waived guard Gary Neal and signed Marcus Thornton to replace him on the roster.

With shooting guard Bradley Beal's playing time limited by injuries recently, and Neal sidelined the past 14 games with a bad leg, the Wizards wanted some backcourt depth.

The Wizards signed Neal as a free agent in July, hoping he could be part of a group of players to help offset the departure of Paul Pierce. Neal averaged 9.8 points for Washington, but he only appeared in 40 of the team's 63 games entering Wednesday.

Thornton has played seven seasons with six NBA teams, averaging 12.4 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists.

In 47 games with the Houston Rockets this season, Thornton averaged 10 points. Houston waived him last month.
714f68d5-33e0-4145-885a-ae5639bd856b  — Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin's chance of participating in the Rio Olympics hasn't been jeopardized by his injuries or his suspension for punching a team staff member.

USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Wednesday that he doesn't judge people based on poor decisions they may have made.

Griffin was suspended four games and docked five games' pay totaling $859,442 for his altercation with the team's assistant equipment manager at a Toronto restaurant on Jan. 23. The star forward is recovering from a broken hand. Griffin had been out since Dec. 26 with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon when the punch-out occurred.

Colangelo says the 12-member U.S. national team will be selected from June 26-28. The team will open a weeklong training camp in Las Vegas on July 17.
2d0a0ab2-484c-4205-93d3-7de3903a8687  — Washington's Alan Anderson was ejected from the Wizards' game against Portland on Tuesday night after he elbowed Gerald Henderson in the face.

The two players scuffled with 1:23 left in the first quarter and had to be separated by their teammates. After a review, Henderson was given a personal foul, and he and Anderson each got technical fouls. Anderson was ejected for the elbow.

The loss of Anderson was a blow to the Wizards, who were without guard Bradley Beal because of a sprained pelvis.

Anderson was averaging 9.2 points and 2.6 rebounds after missing the first 55 games of the season following left ankle surgery. The Wizards have been managing his minutes since his return.
46fd9adf-18e4-49be-9404-0561bf2b1a16  — The New Orleans Pelicans say guard Eric Gordon has undergone surgery to repair his fractured right ring finger and will miss the remainder of the season.

Gordon's injury occurred on Saturday night against Utah, the second time this season he injured the same finger. A similar injury sidelined him 16 games. When the 6-foot-4 Gordon finally returned a little more than a week ago, he averaged nearly 23 points during three full games before re-injuring his finger in the first half of Saturday night's loss.

The 27-year-old Gordon, who is in the final season of his contract, has played in 45 games this season, averaging 15.2 points, 2.7 assists, 2.2 rebounds and a steal in 32.9 minutes per game.
02c1e747-4aa0-4367-9ef1-ef4005c82b0c  — The New Orleans Pelicans announced today that guard Eric Gordon underwent successful surgery this afternoon to repair his fractured right ring finger. He will miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season.

Gordon, 6-4, 215, has appeared in 45 games this season for New Orleans, averaging 15.2 points, 2.7 assists, 2.2 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 32.9 minutes per contest.
8ffd78c7-50ea-44d8-9265-591449acc561  — So what if coach Steve Kerr added a pair of extra turnovers to his team's ugly, uncharacteristic two-day total. He made his point that the Golden State Warriors' sloppy play of late must stop - and now. Well before the playoffs begin as the record-setting NBA champions chase another title.

"Yeah, 46 turnovers in the last 36 hours, inexcusable," Kerr said of what should actually have been 44 turnovers. "I think the team leading the league averages 12 or 13 a game so some are going to happen, but I can rattle off 10 easy that were just inexcusable. Sometimes the game comes too easy for our guys and they just think they can do anything."

That's largely because Golden State has been so, so good this season. Far better than during that special run to the franchise's first title in 40 years last year.

Sure, the Warriors won a 45th straight regular-season home game on Monday night to surpass the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' previous-best mark and improve to 56-6. Yes, reigning MVP Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to make 300 3-pointers in a single season - with 20 games still to go.

"It's still kind of surreal to have accomplished that knowing that I love to shoot the ball and I try to do it at a high level," Curry said.

All those milestones can be properly celebrated, Kerr just wants more from this group than what he has seen of late. He wants his Warriors to know one thing about the turnovers after matching a season high with 24 on Monday against the Magic: "That's kind of our weakness."

"If we don't get that cleaned up then we are in big trouble," Kerr said. "That's a major goal for us going forward."

The miscues nearly cost Golden State on its precious home floor in Oracle Arena, where the Warriors held off Orlando 119-113. A day earlier, they lost 112-95 to the lowly Lakers in Los Angeles with 20 turnovers.

"Over the course of 82 games, anything's liable to happen," Curry said. "You give them that many extra possessions, a talented NBA team that gets paid just like we do, you're going to be in trouble if you don't take care of the ball."

Curry scored 41 points Monday in another spectacular outing. It was his 12th 40-point performance of the season, most by a Warriors player since Hall of Famer Rick Barry's 15 in 1974-75.

"We are winning and Steph is bailing us out an awful lot and he bailed us out tonight," Kerr said. "But we can't count on that and we can't rely on that. We need to get back to being the best defensive team in the league, which we were a year ago - which we are not right now anywhere close to."

Curry considers it his job as Golden State's best player - not to mention the NBA's biggest star - to do just that.

"My job on the floor is to help our team win," he said. "I kind of see it as that's what I'm supposed to do."

Despite the struggles the past couple of games, Kerr realizes how special his team's unbeaten run at home is. He was part of history himself alongside Michael Jordan in Chicago.

He was part of that Bulls team that won 44 in a row at the United Center, and now the Warriors are trying to top Chicago's record 72-win season that year.

"Remarkable by our players over these last two years," Kerr said. "The effort and the consistency it takes to do that. Pretty amazing. There are so many games where the ball could bounce either way and we definitely had some of those during the streak. Could have lost several times last year and could have lost tonight very easily. We keep putting ourselves in position to win games and dominate our home floor and I'm really proud of the guys for that."
69508b3e-d502-48ad-a881-eff11c70ce79  — The Chicago Bulls hope to have Jimmy Butler back for their next game after the swelling in the two-time All-Star guard's left knee went down.

Coach Fred Hoiberg said Tuesday he hopes he returns to the lineup Thursday at San Antonio. Butler sat out Monday's win over Milwaukee because of swelling in the same knee that had sidelined him for 11 games.

He returned to score 24 points while playing 34 minutes in Saturday's win over Houston but experienced stiffness in his back the following day. Butler then developed swelling in his knee on Monday.

Hoiberg also said forward Bobby Portis was experiencing blurred vision after leaving the Bucks game because of a left orbital contusion. But guard Aaron Brooks was feeling better after exiting with right patellar tendinitis.
9b4dcde4-5989-458c-b024-3b36dcb80383  — The Phoenix Suns have signed forward Chase Budinger for the rest of the season.

The 27-year-old former University of Arizona player was waived by the Indiana Pacers on Saturday. He is in his seventh NBA season and has also played for Houston and Minnesota.

Budinger averaged 4.4 points in 49 games with the Pacers this season. He has averaged 8.1 points and 3.1 rebounds for his career.

The Rockets drafted Budinger in the second round in 2009. He averaged a career-best 9.8 points with Houston in 2010-11.

The Suns also signed forward-center Alan Williams to a 10-day contract. Williams, undrafted out of UC-Santa Barbara last year, played in China this season.
c975dbb2-98e4-4938-9838-a7e5009fd100  — The Brooklyn Nets have hired Trajan Langdon as assistant general manager.

The former Duke star had a successful international career playing for Russia's CSKA Moscow, owned by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. He has spent the past few seasons working for the Spurs and Cavaliers organizations.

He was a pro scout for San Antonio from 2012-15, where he worked with new Nets GM Sean Marks, and has been with Cleveland since September as director of player administration and basketball operations.

Marks was hired last month to replace Billy King and said he planned to expand the Nets' staff. He says Tuesday in a statement that Langdon "brings a unique combination of NBA and European experience to the position."
a881fcb9-df7f-44af-89e0-200b982ecd9e  — Jimmy Butler's return from a knee injury lasted all of one game, and the Chicago Bulls aren't sure when the All-Star guard will be able to play again.

Butler missed 11 games with a strained left knee before he had 24 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in Chicago's 108-100 victory over Houston on Saturday night. But he had some stiffness in his back on Sunday and then developed some swelling in his knee on Monday, prompting the Bulls to hold him out for their matchup with Milwaukee.

"He'll meet with the team doctor tonight and we'll kind of go from there," coach Fred Hoiberg said before the game against the Bucks. "As of right now it's just too early to tell how long he'll be, he may feel much better tomorrow. You know I would imagine some type of test will happen in the next few days."

It's an ominous sign for Chicago, which is in jeopardy of missing of the playoffs for the first time since it went 33-49 in the 2007-08 season. The Bulls began the day in a virtual tie with Detroit for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

Heading into the visit by Milwaukee, Chicago had lost 140 games due to injury or illness. It lost 148 games all of last season.

"Obviously, there's concern. Jimmy's a warrior, he's going to try to play through anything," Hoiberg said. "He developed swelling around that knee and he's got a lot of soreness in there. Just too early to tell exactly how long this one will be. He's optimistic he'll be back soon in talking to him, and I'll never doubt him."

The 26-year-old Butler played 34 minutes against the Rockets and is averaging 37.8 minutes in his fifth NBA season, a slight decrease from his average of 38.7 minutes in each of the past two years, but tied with Rockets star James Harden for the league lead heading into Monday's games.

The Bulls also got Nikola Mirotic back against the Rockets, but Hoiberg said he is limited to somewhere between 15 to 20 minutes against the Bucks. Mirotic missed 16 games following an appendectomy and subsequent procedure to remove a blood clot.

The 26-year-old Butler is averaging 22.4 points in 49 games this season. Chicago dropped eight of 11 games while he was out with his recent knee injury.
928db8fe-8cee-47c7-854e-bd8d4690f467  — The Memphis Grizzlies are down to just one healthy starter against the Cavaliers.

The team will be missing four starters, point guard Mike Conley, center Chris Andersen and forwards Zach Randolph and Matt Barnes, Monday night when they take on LeBron James and the Eastern Conference's top team.

The banged-up Grizzlies are already missing franchise center Marc Gasol.

The Grizzlies initially announced that both Conley (foot) and Andersen (shoulder) would sit. But then coach David Joerger said during his pregame availability about 90 minutes before the opening tip that Randolph (knee) and Barnes (hamstring) will also rest.

Joerger said Conley underwent an MRI and the team hopes to have more information on him and Andersen later this week.

"We'll look at them more at the end of the week," Joerger said. "They are going to be out for a while."

Joerger still hadn't decided who would start against the Cavs, who are 27-5 at home this season.

One positive for the Grizzlies is that guard Tony Allen is back after missing eight games with a sore left knee.

Conley is the club's playmaker, averaging 15.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and a team-high 6.1 assists in 56 starts this season. Andersen is averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds in 16 games for both Memphis and Miami.

Randolph averages 14.6 points and 7.9 rebounds, and Barnes averages 9.0 points and 5.1 rebounds.

Joerger said the Grizzlies hope to have an update by Friday on Conley and Andersen, who injured his shoulder in Sunday's loss at Phoenix. After playing Cleveland, Memphis visits Boston on Wednesday.

The Grizzlies have had a rash of major injuries this season. Gasol is done for the season with a broken right foot and forward Brandan Wright has been sidelined with a strained right knee.
ec36ac24-f439-42ca-a7a8-7abd3f52453d  — The Memphis Grizzlies will play their next two games without guard Mike Conley and center Chris Andersen because of injuries, and the duo will be re-evaluated within the next five days.

The Grizzlies announced Monday that Andersen dislocated his left shoulder in the second quarter of Sunday's loss to Phoenix, while Conley has soreness in his left foot.

Conley and Andersen will miss both Monday night's game at Cleveland and Wednesday's game at Boston.

The Grizzlies already are without center Marc Gasol who had surgery last month to repair a broken navicular bone in his right foot.

Conley is averaging 15.3 points and a team-high 6.1 assists in 56 starts this season. Andersen is averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds in his 16 games this season with Memphis and Miami.
849cffc9-5735-48bb-a2bd-96ea824f42e2  — Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart has been fined $15,000 for making an obscene gesture, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

The incident occurred with 1:49 remaining in the third quarter of the Celtics' 105-104 win over the New York Knicks on March 4 at TD Garden.
8e8b4029-2d8b-4be5-85a2-0293937efbb5  — The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James and the San Antonio Spurs' Kawhi Leonard today were named NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for games played Monday, Feb. 29 through Sunday, March 6.

James led the Cavaliers to a 3-0 week behind averages of 26.7 points (fifth in the Eastern Conference), 9.7 rebounds (tied-eighth in the conference), 6.3 assists (tied-eighth in the conference) and 2.33 steals (tied-fourth in the conference). James opened the week with a 33-point outing in a 100-96 win over the Indiana Pacers on Feb. 29. He closed the week with back-to-back point-rebound double-doubles, including a 28-point, 11-board effort during a 120-103 win over the Boston Celtics on March 5.

Leonard led the Spurs to the Western Conference's lone perfect record for the week at 3-0. He averaged a double-double with 27.3 points (fourth in the conference) and 10.0 rebounds, and added 4.7 assists and 1.7 steals. Leonard connected on 6-of-10 three-point field goals during a 30-point, 11-rebound performance in a 94-86 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on March 3.

91c654f6-da3c-4c12-85b2-944762d541e8  — Milwaukee Bucks point guard Michael Carter-Williams will have season-ending left hip surgery on Thursday.

Carter-Williams will have a torn labrum repaired in Colorado, general manager John Hammond said Monday in a release. The estimated recovery time for the 11th overall selection in the 2013 draft is three months.

Carter-Williams averaged 11.5 points, 5.1 rebounds, and a team-high 5.2 assists in 54 games this season, including 37 starts.

Most recently, Carter-Williams came off the bench with young forward Giannis Antetokounmpo taking over more of the ball-handling responsibilities in the starting lineup.

"We're going to miss Mike, understanding what he's done for us all season," coach Jason Kidd said before Monday night's game at Chicago. "Been asked to come off the bench, we've had him start, averaging over 11 points, rebounding the ball for us, assists, and then defensively, he's always taken the assignment of one of the best perimeter guys."

The third-year guard has been dealing with discomfort in his hip since late December, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not yet fully discussed details of his condition.

Carter-Williams spent the next two months trying to play through it and was hoping to finish the season before addressing the injury, but doctors informed him he needed to surgery now, the person said.

"I think Mike being young enough, he's going to bounce back and be stronger from this surgery," Kidd said.

Carter-Williams' scoring average was the lowest of his career, but he did shoot a career-high 45 percent from the field.

Carter-Williams came to the Bucks from Philadelphia last season as part of a remaking of Milwaukee's backcourt in a deal that sent Brandon Knight to Phoenix. The former lottery pick was the Rookie of the Year in 2013-14 for the 76ers.

The loss of Carter-Williams is the latest setback for a Bucks backcourt that has also been without veteran Greivis Vasquez for most of the season because of right ankle surgery.
4f53aa6f-be4a-4c8c-9f6f-11d1cc365a97  — LeBron James has 28.6 million followers on Twitter. Lately, he seems interested in connecting with only a few of them.

James has spent part of the past week sending cryptic messages on the social media platform, leading to speculation he's unhappy with a teammate or plotting another move. The Cavaliers star won't divulge the meanings of his tweets or their intended targets and explained Monday that he's simply exercising his brain.

"It's just my mind working, that's all," James said following shootaround as the Cavs prepared to host the Memphis Grizzlies. "I don't know if anything started it. Just my mind working. I got a beautiful mind and I want to use it sometimes in a social manner."

The recent rash of tweets, which have included hashtags like (hash)TheDC, have caused a stir because James has been relatively quiet on Twitter this year and because virtually everything the four-time NBA MVP does is scrutinized.

James could be toying with everyone, and he'll likely swear off social media completely in the postseason, a concession that has become a ritual for him in recent seasons.

However, James understands the impact of his posts, which is why he continues to send them. It's possible he could be reaching out to motivate one of his Cleveland teammates since he's done that in the past. Whatever the case, James said deciphering the messages is easy for some.

"If you have an educated mind, they hit home for you," he said. "Last night I tweeted that consistency and structure breeds perfection and if you take a short cut, or if you don't handle business then you come up short. I think everybody should understand that. It's nothing between the lines, it's just, life. You can't shortcut being perfect or trying to be as perfect as you can, or trying to get to a point where you just feel like you can succeed. So, for educated minds, it should be fine."

James, who also raised some eyebrows by traveling to Florida last week to work out with former Miami teammate Dwyane Wade, knows his Twitter teases will bring him more criticism.

Inside the NBA: LeBron And Wade Workout The Inside crew discuss LeBron James and Dwyane Wade working out together during the season.

He doesn't care.

James said during his second season playing with the Heat that he stopped agonizing about what others think about him.

"I just stopped, it became too much where I was worried about what other people think instead of just making the main thing the main thing, and that's just playing the game of basketball that I love and being happy about being in this situation," he said. "I'm a blessed kid from, you guys know the story, 40 miles south of here. I've got a beautiful family, beautiful teammates and this game of basketball has brought me so much. So the outside noises just really don't affect me."

James is expected to sit out some upcoming games. Coach Tyronn Lue wants to rest him and other starters before the postseason. James said he and Lue have not yet plotted out when he'll sit.

"We've discussed a few things, but it's still day to day though," he said. "We want to go day by day and not try to plan too much."
ce17547c-b028-4962-8851-5d23df0f6c15  — Indiana is willing to bet on troubled point guard Ty Lawson getting his career back on track.

If he does, the Pacers could get a windfall payoff.

If he doesn't, Lawson's once-promising career could be over.

On Monday, Pacers president of basketball operations Larry Bird announced that Lawson had been signed to a contract. Terms of the deal were not immediately available.

Before Monday night's game against San Antonio, Pacers coach Frank Vogel said he believes Lawson will feel at home in Indy.

"Every situation is different," Vogel said. "(In Houston), they sort of give the ball to James Harden, so maybe that was not a good fit for that. Maybe he'll be a better fit here."

The Pacers were looking for a backup point guard, and Bird has always shown interest in Lawson. In fact, Lawson's name had been linked to the Pacers in rumored trades long before the start of this season.

It's not the first time Bird has made this type of move. Two years ago, Bird gambled on bringing in the oft-injured Andrew Bynum, who played only two games before re-injuring his knee.

Lawson comes to the Pacers (33-30) with a different set of questions. He was arrested twice last year on drunken-driving charges, once in Denver and once in Los Angeles, before being traded from Denver to Houston last summer.

Eleven games into the season, Lawson lost his starting job. His continued struggles prompted the Rockets to buy out his contract last week.

Now, in a new place, the 5-foot-11 Lawson is trying to clean up his public image.

"This is a good opportunity for me to come here, try to help the Pacers win and get into the playoffs," Lawson said in a statement issued by the team. "I'm just ready to play and do whatever is needed."

Lawson has averaged 13.3 points and 5.8 assists over his career and is expected to back up George Hill as Indiana makes a second-half playoff push.

Vogel said Lawson will likely play some minutes against the Spurs and that his playing time is likely to increase as he becomes more familiar with the offense and his teammates.

"I feel like this is a clean slate for him," Vogel said. "I think he'll come in and play well for us."
ee9a956d-de19-4c0f-a447-1e1535b2c611  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

1f9988cd-6633-4a5e-b791-b1b92b2fd7f7  — Carmelo Anthony is missing the Knicks' game against Sacramento on Sunday night because of a migraine.

Anthony was bothered by a migraine during a loss in Washington on Saturday and was still experiencing symptoms Sunday and having trouble with lights. Interim coach Kurt Rambis originally said the Knicks' leading scorer would be a game-time decision, but the team officially ruled out him shortly after.

Arron Afflalo is starting for Anthony, who averages 21.8 points. The Knicks are 0-7 without Anthony this season.

New York also recalled forward Cleanthony Early, who hasn't played since getting shot in the right knee during a robbery on Dec. 30.
25deb74c-d5f7-4a07-ae9b-a2d2bdb8ad6b  — Anthony Davis is expected to miss this summer's Olympic Games because of knee and shoulder injuries that have ended his fourth NBA season early.

While Davis stopped short of completely ruling himself out Monday, USA Basketball later said the All-Star forward would be unavailable for Rio.

"I love USA Basketball. I loved when I was there in 2012. I loved when I played in the (FIBA) World Cup in 2014," Davis said. "But I think everyone understands where health is more important."

On Sunday evening, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry announced that the 6-foot-10 Davis, who has posted team-leading averages of 24.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 61 games, would sit out New Orleans' final 14 regular season games so he can focus on treating a torn labrum in his left shoulder - which will require surgery - and tendinosis in his left knee.

"I love playing for USA basketball and representing my country," Davis said, then added it's "probably going to be ruled out because of the timetable as far as recovery, but hopefully I'll get a chance to play again with Team USA."

In a posting on Facebook, USA Basketball said it was disappointed to learn of Davis' injuries and unavailability for national team duty.

"However, Anthony getting back to 100 percent is what is most important at this time," USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said in the statement.

"We wish AD a quick and full recovery and look forward to having him represent the United States again."

Speaking Monday at the Pelicans' practice headquarters, Davis said he will travel soon to see an orthopedic specialist in Los Angeles. He said rehabilitation from shoulder surgery is projected to last four or five months. Davis is unsure precisely what type of procedure he will undergo on his knee, but said he expected to be healthy by early in the next NBA season.

Davis said he doesn't need to have shoulder surgery now. In fact, he said he has been playing with the injury to his non-shooting shoulder since he first tore his labrum during his rookie NBA season (2012-13) after he selected No. 1 overall out of Kentucky. But now that he needs treatment on his knee, however, Davis and team officials agreed that he should treat both injuries together.

"I always just played through it," Davis said of his shoulder injury. "It was gradually getting worse. ... The biggest thing was just because of the knee.

"We might as well do the shoulder instead of waiting and then something happens to the shoulder and then you're just wasting time."

Added Gentry, "It's just a time and situation right now where you can take care of all of it."

The coach applauded Davis for his toughness and his eagerness to keep playing even as it became increasingly clear that New Orleans (26-43), which has been decimated by season-ending injuries to four starters, would not be a playoff team. To Gentry, once Davis' knee began to bother him, it no longer made sense to keep the 23-year-old franchise player on the court.

"The risk-reward just wasn't there to do that," Gentry said. "He wanted to try everything that he could to play. He loves being with his teammates and he loves playing. He's as easy a superstar to coach as I've ever been around. He just wants to be one of the guys and do everything that you can possibly do.

"He'll come back and he'll be better than ever (next season) because that's just who he is," Gentry added. "He'll work his way to the point where all of this will be a plus."

Davis last played in the first half of the Pelicans' loss to Portland last Friday. He left the game shortly after setting a screen in which he collided with Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum and Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday. But Davis stressed that his knee had started bothering him well before that play, causing him on some occasions to attempt lay-ups instead of dunks.

"I couldn't explode. I didn't feel like myself," Davis said. "There were a couple plays were I could have dunked the ball where I couldn't really get up. It was just bothering me to the point that I couldn't really move and do the things that I usually do on the basketball floor."
78e39be0-7932-4273-8673-456961fa4f75  Anthony Davis' season is over. Alvin Gentry told reporters during his pregame media session Sunday that New Orleans has decided to shut down the three-time All-Star for the remaining 14 games of 2015-16, a decision that factors in the 23-year-old's left knee and shoulder injuries.

"We're going to shut him down. He's done for the year," Gentry said. "It's unfortunate, but he's got an issue with his shoulder that he's played with the whole season. It's amazing when people talk about him being soft or whatever; they don't understand that he's played through a situation with his shoulder the entire season."
fb3c0079-fc6c-4785-9c61-f69ab153b628  — Now that the Spurs have cut the Warriors down to size and demonstrated that Stephen Curry can be made to look human, there is only one question left for the rest of the basketball world:

What did it prove?

No matter how the mammoth, bombastically-hyped matchup turned out on Saturday night, the two teams were guaranteed to make NBA history.

Highlights: Spurs down Warriors With 26 points and 13 rebounds, LaMarcus Aldridge leads the Spurs past the visiting Warriors, 87-79.

With the Warriors entering with a record of 62-6 and the Spurs at 58-10, the game featured the highest combined win percentage (88.2) ever.

Never had there been a game between teams more than 100 games (104) over-.500.This was a game carrying considerable weight, though Spurs contrarian coach Gregg Popovich typically expressed utter indifference about the matchup's importance.

"Write whatever the hell you want," Popovich said before tipoff. "Say I said, 'Yes.' "

Yes, the Spurs clawed and carved out an 87-79 victory that just might be a glimpse of what we'll see if the two teams meet up again as everyone expects in the Western Conference finals.

Starting lineups and in-game matchups that look like they may have been drawn out of a hat. Hall of Famer Tim Duncan sitting for all but eight minutes on the Spurs bench, jumping up and down as a cheerleader and often acting as another assistant coach. Curry and his Warriors backcourt partner Klay Thompson usually having so little room to breathe.

As masterpieces go, it ranked between the Sistine Chapel ceiling and something you might find stuck to the door of a refrigerator with a magnet.

As results go, it was precisely the kind of ugly, discordant scrum that the Spurs will want to stifle the harmony and creativity of Golden State.

"I told the guys I thought their execution and competitiveness defensively were outstanding and that's something you can depend on night after night," Popovich said. "You never know if you're going to make shots or not, but if you can be consistent with your defense you're in the ballgame. And I thought that this was one of our better...execution games in following what we were trying to do."

The Spurs limited Curry to 4-for-18 shooting — 1-12 on 3-point shots — and 14 points and Thompson to 7-20 — 1-7 on treys — and 15 points to hold the Warriors to their lowest scoring game of the season.

They did it, especially on Curry by keeping a man on him, switching often, closing his space to operate on the perimeter and forcing him to drive the ball to the basket. If it wasn't Tony Parker or Danny Green or Kawhi Leonard or Patty Mills in his face, then it was the San Antonio bigs LaMarcus Aldridge and Boris Diaw stepping away from the basket to shut down Curry's looks at the basket.

"All you can do is just be there," Aldridge said.

Postgame: Aldridge on victory LaMarcus Aldridge discusses the Spurs' victory over the Warriors in their second matchup of the season.

The Warriors were playing without the injured Andre Iguodala, Festus Ezeli and Andrew Bogut. What's more, this was their sixth game in the space of nine nights and the second of back-to-back set after playing Friday in Dallas.

When the Warriors won a 120-90 rout in their first meeting back on Jan. 25 in Oakland, Manu Ginobili had simply said they were better than the Spurs.

"I wouldn't say that its even (now)," Ginobili said. "They have a better record. They are playing unbelievable basketball and they played yesterday. That's an advantage (for us). They were also missing a few guys. Of course, we love the win. We enjoyed it. I thought we did a great job. But I don't think it's the type of team we're gonna see if we happen to face them in the playoffs. We have got to be very humble because of the situation, the way they got here."

The Warriors have gotten here by pushing the boundaries of the game to often make it less of a competition and more of a performance by them, by making the game smaller and faster and forcing opponents into difficult, if not impossible, matchups.

But when Golden State coach Steve Kerr went to a starting lineup that did not have a single player taller than 6-foot-8, Popovich turned the tables by sitting the all-time greatest player in franchise history and countering with the versatile and burly Diaw in the middle. Quite simply, the 39-year-old Duncan wasn't going to be able to guard anybody.

"You make decisions all the time," said Popovich. "You just try to do what you think's best for the group. It doesn't mean you're going to be right or wrong every time, but you just make decisions based on what's going on and what's in front of you."

"That's what the Spurs are about," Diaw said. "The culture here is everybody is selfless and unselfish. So for (Duncan), if he knows that the game plan is to win the game, he's going to be on board with it."

Diaw set the pace early by attacking the basket, shooting 6-for-7 for 14 points and eight rebounds. And the Spurs used the height advantage of the 6-11 Aldridge to punish the Warriors down on the low block.

One can envision a best-of-seven playoff series crammed with more planning and deep thinking than a chess match, enough switches and changes and hunches to make your head spin.

What it all means is that the Spurs kept their perfect record (35-0) at home and pushed the regular season winning streak over the Warriors up to 33 games, dating back to Valentine's Day of 1997. It means the Spurs have closed the gap in the standings to three games in the race for the overall No. 1 seed in the playoffs. It means the Warriors' bid to win 73 games and set a new NBA record for a single season got a little tougher.

But what did it prove?

Just that the best is yet to come.

386a06a2-b907-43d5-898b-f8528bad8a27  — The NBA is reviewing Dwight Howard's use of a sticky substance on his hands in Houston's loss at the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night.

Atlanta's Paul Millsap complained about the ball while shooting two free throws with 3:36 remaining in the first quarter. Howard made a layup with 4:04 remaining.

"I've never felt the ball like that ever," Millsap told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "It was sticky. It was like super glue or something was on there. I couldn't get it off my hands. It was the weirdest thing ever."

Referees gave warnings to each bench and then approached the scorer's table, where they were directed to a can covered with white tape. The can was taken off the table and one of the officials told the scorer to alert him if it was seen again.

There was no penalty issued during the game, but a league spokesman said Saturday night's incident is under review.

"I've been using it for the last five years," Howard told the Houston Chronicle. "It hasn't been a problem. I don't know why people are making a big deal out of it. I do it every game. It's not a big deal. I ain't even tripping."
27c31705-1524-428c-877c-5cad32a867ee  — Dwyane Wade always figured that 20,000 points would be enough to officially stamp him as an NBA great.

He's now there.

The Heat guard reached the milestone Saturday night, with a short floater with 10:18 left in the third quarter of Miami's home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wade is the 41st player to score 20,000, doing so in his 844th game, and the ninth active one.

During the next stoppage in play, Wade accepted congratulations from teammates, waved to fans who gave him a standing ovation and got a congratulatory pat from former teammate LeBron James. They chatted for a few moments, Wade smiling broadly.

"I always thought, I don't know why, that 20,000 just seemed good," Wade told The Associated Press in an interview as he approached the milestone. "When you're in the NBA and they say you scored 20,000 points or whatever, that's a small group and I wanted to be in that category. Obviously, because of what I've chosen to do, giving up some of those opportunities, missing a lot of games, my style of play, to reach that point for me is big."

Wade is the 21st-quickest to get to 20,000, according to STATS, and could have likely gotten there a lot faster if he was so inclined. He was instrumental in the Heat adding James and Chris Bosh in 2010, a move that helped Wade and the Heat win the second and third of their three NBA titles but surely slowed down his scoring pace.

"He has so many unique, special, professional ways about him and he's done it all in the same uniform," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "You have to have Hall of Fame talent. What he's matched that with is a consistent work ethic, an ability to produce year after year. The sign of greatness is consistency."

Wade came into Saturday averaging 23.7 points for his career, fifth among active players behind only Kevin Durant, James, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony. He's a shooting guard who was never an elite shooter from deep - never shooting better than 32 percent from 3-point range in a season - but knew early in his career that he could still be a successful scorer.

And the critics who insisted he couldn't shoot helped as well.

"When it comes to criticism, we don't like it, but we need it," Wade said. "In a sense I'm happy people said those things. I'm still not Steph Curry or Ray Allen or Joe Johnson, but I always said I'm a shot maker. I'm not a shooter. My body makeup and mechanics is not like that. I'm a shot maker and that's what I've been my whole life, someone who can make shots, score the basketball and find a way."

That's what he did.

He would work for hours before and after practices with Spoelstra, who was then an assistant, developing his midrange game. The payoffs came quickly, with the Heat winning a title in his third season and Wade being the league's scoring champion in 2008-09. And as the Heat have changed, Wade adapted his game each time to fit in best.

"A lot of times, proud, veteran, proven players don't have the ability to adapt," Spoelstra said. "You have to adapt to them. He's so unique in that regard."

Wade started the season 54th on the NBA's career scoring list, and he's now one of only five players 6-foot-4 or shorter to reach 20,000, joining Jerry West, Allen Iverson, Gary Payton and Hal Greer.

Wade has shrugged off many of the stat-milestone events in his career, but he insisted this one will have a special significance.

"Somebody's going to pass me one day, but it's kind of cool to see my name - while I'm still playing - among the 50 greatest players," Wade said. "They gave us all something to shoot for."
be5c8744-b9f0-4bc0-b6dc-857afe301fa5  — Brook Lopez is out of the lineup for the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night against Detroit because of a virus.

It's only the second game Lopez has missed this season. The 7-foot center is averaging 20.6 points and 8.0 rebounds.

The Nets came into the game having lost seven of nine. Lopez scored only nine points in a 118-102 loss to Chicago on Thursday night.
7174056f-eb3f-4062-8da8-823cb86d1690  — Golden State starting center Andrew Bogut will not play in the Warriors' game at San Antonio on Saturday night because of a foot injury.

Golden State, which has lost 32 straight regular-season games in San Antonio, was already without key reserves Andre Iguodala (sprained left ankle) and Festus Ezeli (left knee surgery).

Bogut strained his left big toe Friday night in a 130-112 victory in Dallas. Bogut had two points and two rebounds in nine minutes.

Golden State has not won in San Antonio since Feb. 14, 1997, but walloped the Spurs 120-90 on Jan. 25 at the Oracle Arena in the first showdown between the league's two most dominant teams.

Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said everyone is available for San Antonio.

The Warriors (62-6) hold a four-game lead over the Spurs (58-10) for the league's top seed with a month remaining in the regular season. They will meet again April 7 at Golden State and April 10 in San Antonio.

San Antonio has won 43 straight home games dating to last season, which is one shy of matching the 1995-96 Bulls for the second-longest streak in league history. Golden State is currently on a 50-game home winning streak dating to January 2015.

The New York Knicks hold the record for road futility, losing 43 straight to the Los Angeles Lakers from 1975-92.
36d9ac6f-5926-4bc3-ab1e-21e1a1665ba2  — Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward will return Saturday night against the Chicago Bulls after missing the previous two games with plantar fasciitis of the right foot.

Hayward, who leads the Jazz in scoring with an average of 20.1 points, told the team he felt well enough to play following the morning shootaround.

Coach Quin Snyder said Hayward will not be under a minutes restriction.

"The nature of the injury is it's pain-related," Snyder said. "Rest and treatment is really the only thing that can improve it. We'll just take it day-by-day and see how he's doing."

The game against the Bulls is the start of a five-game trip for Utah, which enters with a four-game winning streak.

"Getting Gordon back is a boost going on this trip," Snyder said. "What you're able to sustain at home, as far as energy, is more difficult on the road."
2054f473-57f5-4eed-a47a-cb7b8a26f57f  — Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes was out of Saturday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers after the NBA suspended him one game, saying he tried to enter Milwaukee's locker room and verbally challenge Bucks forward John Henson after both players were ejected.

On Thursday, Henson blocked Barnes' shot with 5.5 seconds left in the Bucks' 96-86 win over the Grizzlies in Milwaukee. After the play, Henson taunted Barnes and was given two technical fouls and ejected. Barnes was charged with a technical foul and ejected for continuing to use obscenities.

Barnes told the Los Angeles Times that he was led astray by an arena worker.

The NBA says he will serve his suspension without pay Saturday night when Memphis hosts the Clippers.

The NBA also announced Saturday that Milwaukee guard Greivis Vasquez has been fined $15,000 for following Henson to the locker room, while Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and center Greg Monroe have been fined $10,000 each for their roles.

Per league rules, Barnes was not in the building for the Clippers game and unavailable for comment.

Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he learned of the suspension about 2 1/2 hours before game time.

"It's a tough deal," said Joerger, who is coaching through a rash of injuries, including core players Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph and Mike Conley, along with reserves Brandan Wright and Chris Andersen. "...You might agree or disagree, I'm not going to get into that."

Joerger said he would like to have known Friday night or Saturday morning, where he could adjust his game plan to Barnes' absence. But, he added, it's paramount the league is thorough in such situations.

"I'm sure when you look into those kinds of situations, you ask 12 different people, I'm sure you get 11 or 12 different answers on what exactly went on," he said.

One factor in Barnes' suspension, according to the league, was his continuing use of obscenities. Asked if he had heard of such reasoning, Joerger replied with a laugh: "Then I would have got thrown out."
a165cb94-d31e-4f71-ab3d-2503388f5ba4  — Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes has been suspended one game without pay for attempting to enter the Milwaukee Bucks' locker room and verbally challenging Milwaukee forward John Henson following both players' ejections on Thursday, March 17, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

In addition, Milwaukee guard Greivis Vasquez has been fined $15,000 for following Henson to the locker room, while Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and center Greg Monroe have each been fined $10,000 for their roles in the incident.

The incident began when Henson blocked Barnes' shot with 5.5 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of the Bucks' 96-86 win over the Grizzlies at BMO Harris Bradley Center. Following the play, Henson taunted Barnes and was subsequently assessed two technical fouls and ejected. Barnes was then charged with a technical foul and ejected for continuing use of obscenities.

Barnes will serve his suspension tonight when Memphis hosts the Los Angeles Clippers at FedExForum.
2fb1a183-ff27-40d2-88eb-286a259d088d  — The Brooklyn Nets have signed guard Sean Kilpatrick to a multiyear contract.

Kilpatrick has averaged 11.9 points in nine games since signing his first of two 10-day contracts on Feb. 28. He has scored in double figures in four straight games and is shooting 47 percent from 3-point range.

Players can sign two consecutive 10-day contracts, and then teams must sign them for the rest of the season if they want to keep them.

Terms of the deal announced Saturday were not disclosed.
3a322ef6-f4c3-49cd-b19b-ec463b2ae0bd  — When the white-hot Warriors and splendid Spurs collide Saturday at the AT&T Center, perhaps all that will be missing is a catwalk for the NBA's two model teams.

Every athlete pays a price to be a part of this kind of atmosphere in this kind of game. Blood, sweat and tears. Hours, nights and years.

David West paid with cash.

The grounded, reliable veteran certainly couldn't have envisioned that he'd be part of such electric fanfare and hoopla amidst two clubs both still chasing 70 wins.

But West's experience this season inside their Spurs locker room and their pursuit of a sixth championship in franchise history is exactly why the power forward gave up a guaranteed $12.6 million with the Pacers to play in San Antonio for the veteran's minimum of $1.49 million.

Was the $11-million decision worth it?

"Probably more," West says with a grin.

West came here not to pursue records so much as an attitude and a sense of satisfaction. After 12 seasons of toiling diligently and effectively among a variety of different teammates, he wanted a 13th that could deliver a similar mindset and professional satisfaction. He wanted to win, for sure. But he also wanted to grow and learn in an organization that never stops growing and learning and he wanted the discipline that comes from a roster full of players that think and act just like he does.

"It's been everything that I expected and hoped it would be," West said. "It's a great experience being around the knowledge and legendary information that these guys have. It's great to walk in and see Tim Duncan every day and talk to him. You've got four guys with Hall of Fame talent here. It's really been a great experience. My family's enjoying it. I have no complaints."

Neither do the Spurs.

There is a constant information flow that comes from everyone, and everybody is chugging in the same direction. Nobody is pulling off to the left or right, with personal stuff and egos and things like that. – Spurs forward David West

From the concentration he brings to each trip up and down the practice floor to the hard edge he brings to every game, West has delivered the professionalism and the worldly experience they wanted. At 35, West is only the fifth-oldest player on the Spurs roster, yet his game and approach are wise beyond his many years in the league.

He is averaging the second-fewest minutes (17.5) of his NBA career and scoring less (7.0) than anytime since 2004-05. He has scored in double figures just 16 times all season. Yet West has been valuable for his ability to mesh with the program and rise to occasions.

A week ago in a high profile showdown against the Thunder, the Spurs trailed by seven points with a little more than five minutes left in the third quarter. Tony Parker and Danny Green were struggling to find their offense to that point neither of them had made a single basket when the veteran forward checked into the game.

It was a familiar sight to West. The first time he wore a Spurs jersey for regular season game was in a loss at Oklahoma City back on opening night.

But so much has changed since then as West has settled in to his role and the Spurs have churned out a perfect 34-0 record at home that has kept them chasing only the other-worldly Steph Curry and the defending champion Warriors.

Make Plans: Saturday Night Primetime on ABC Mashup: Warriors-Spurs Stephen Curry leads the Golden Stater Warriors into San Antonio to face Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs.

This time when the fourth quarter began, West began to assert himself. He knocked down a pair of his specialty mid-range jumpers, then attacked the bucket for a tip-in that tied the game. He would not score again after his solo 6-0 run, but West kept right on blocking shots, blocking out, rebounding and defending as the Spurs secured the win.

"We have a team full of coaches," he said. "There is a constant information flow that comes from everyone, and everybody is chugging in the same direction. Nobody is pulling off to the left or right, with personal stuff and egos and things like that."

He had heard the stories over the years about how the Spurs do this and the Spurs do that and how it's the perfect place to play basketball. Now he's living and believing the experience.

"Every moment, every play means something," West said. "That's what I wanted. Every game, every possession means the world to us.

"There's an ideology that exists here. You just trust it."

Enough to pay the price that David West did for admission to the epic Warriors-Spurs showdown. In cash.

b518da41-6e83-4cab-aa37-6a1c38d0de4c  The window is open -- if only a crack.

With the king of the mountain hobbled, this may be the last (and only) chance for someone to catch him. Is anyone ready to stand up and make a major move? In all honesty, only two guys have a realistic shot at ascending to the top.

A shooting guard's latest cold spell has opened the door for a handful of names. Meanwhile, one player in particular continues to step up for the injury-riddled Grizzlies while a future Hall of Famer falls off the list for the first time since Week 11.

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 17. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 1 game, 17.0 ppg, 12.0 rpg, 9.0 apg

Season stats: 17.0 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 4.1 apg

The big fella only played one game last week because of knee inflammation, but what a stat-stuffer it was: 17 points (7-for-12 shooting, including 2-for-3 3-pointers), 12 rebounds, nine assists and two blocks. With Gasol already listed out for Saturday's game, this is a big opportunity for someone to shake up the OSPR.

2. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 3 games, 24.3 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.7 apg

Ever since we bumped him to No. 5 in Week 15, Nowitzki has played like a man on a mission, averaging 23.1 points on 51.5 FG% in his last eight games. In fact, he now has six straight games of 20 or more points after surpassing the mark just twice in the previous 10 games. Here's your shot at the top of the mountain, Dirk.

3. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 19.0 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.7 apg

This was one of Wade's ugliest weeks in a while (a lingering thigh injury certainly played a role), as he shot just 30.2 from the field and eclipsed 12 points in one of three games. Last Friday's nine-point effort was the first time he didn't register double-figuring scoring since going for eight on Feb. 14, a span of 11 games.

4. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 4 games, 18.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.0 apg

Season stats: 12.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.9 apg

With his teammate off, Johnson picked up the slack, going for 13 or more points in all four games on 52.9 FG%, 52.6 3PT% and 83.3 FT%. Johnson has now gone four straight games with two or more 3-pointers and seven consecutive of 50 percent or better from the field. It certainly looks like Johnson has found his stroke.

Johnson Hits 28 Joe Johnson drops 28 points on 11-21 shooting with five assists and four rebounds versus Toronto.

5. Matt Barnes (36), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 5 games, 16.0 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 3.6 apg

Season stats: 9.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

The good: four games with 14 or more points. The bad: 33.7 shooting from the field. The impressive: a career-first triple-double last Friday (26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists). Also falling under the good category is the fact Barnes has made two or more 3-pointers in seven of his last eight games.

Nightly Notable: Matt Barnes Matt Barnes scores 26 points with 11 rebounds and 10 assists to record the first triple-double of his career.

6. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: 8

Last week's stats: 3 games, 10.0 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 6.4 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

Aside from Thursday's four-point, two-rebound performance against the Jazz, Chandler has been balling -- to the tune of nine or more rebounds in seven of his last eight. He's also managed four double-doubles in the last seven and is shooting 64.8 from the field in the last nine.

7. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.5 ppg, 1.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 13.7 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.2 apg

Is it getting drafty in here or what? It doesn't get much more frigid than Crawford's shooting last week (12-for-42 for 28.6 percent from the field). In fact, since being elevated to No. 3 on our list in Week 15, Crawford has hit a rough patch, shooting 50 percent or better from the field in just once in the previous eight games.

8. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 8.0 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 8.3 apg

Season stats: 12.2 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.4 apg

If not for Thursday's impressive 18-point, 16-assist showing against the Trail Blazers, Parker would've fallen off the list. That's because the rest of the week was Ugly (yes, with a capital 'U'). In his two other games, Parker averaged 3.0 points, 4.5 assists and 11 percent (1-for-9 shooting) from the field.

Tony Parker's Biggest Assists See highlights from Tony Parker's 16 assist night agains the Trail Blazers.

9. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: Didn't play

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 apg

What have you done for me lately? If you're Z-Bo, nothing. Randolph has missed the last seven games with soreness in his right knee. Before the injury, he managed 15 or more points in five of his last six games. If he misses all of next week's games, Randolph will be off the list for the first time since Week 2.

10. Nene (33), Washington Wizards

Last week's rank: NA

Last week's stats: 5 games, 10.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.6 apg

Season stats: 8.7 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.6 apg

Despite getting just 19.5 minutes last week, Nene was productive enough to climb onto the list. In addition to shooting 57.6 from the field, Nene chipped in 1.6 steals (including four in Monday's win over the Pistons). The big man has now scored in double figures in five of his last seven after going eight consecutive games under 10 points.

Just missed the cut: Tony Allen, Kyle Korver, Jason Terry, Kobe Bryant

f9b3b0d5-35fd-458c-9cc7-1945c578f224  — Pelicans forward Anthony Davis has not returned to the court for the second half of New Orleans' game against Portland on Friday night because of a left knee injury.

Davis scored 19 points in the first half and did not appear to be in significant pain, but at times appeared to have a slight limp and winced a couple times before being subbed out with 51 seconds left in the second quarter.

The Pelicans announced the injury during the third quarter and that Davis was doubtful to return to the game.

Ryan Anderson began the second half in Davis' usual power forward spot.

Davis, a three-time All-Star who turned 22 this month, entered the game averaging 24.4 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.1 blocks.
96c7d2f0-8cd8-4886-8a3d-0dd3e94e0d64  — Sacramento guard Rajon Rondo returned to the lineup against Detroit after missing a game with a variety of injuries.

Rondo was sidelined Wednesday against New Orleans with turf toe, a thumb sprain and a right shoulder bruise. It was the fourth game he's missed this season.

Sacramento was without center Willie Cauley-Stein (illness) on Friday.
a03f3591-d4fd-4ceb-91d8-9a9421c2c5d1  — The Detroit Pistons have signed guard Lorenzo Brown to a 10-day contract.

The team announced the move Friday before its game against Sacramento. The 6-foot-5 Brown has averaged 3.3 points and 13.2 minutes in 63 career games with Philadelphia, Minnesota and Phoenix. He was signed to two 10-day contracts with the Suns this season and averaged 2.5 points and 7.6 minutes in eight games.

Brown was taken in the second round of the 2013 draft by Minnesota.

3a35f73c-190f-4b61-bfdb-f5487bf2333e  Most athletes would stop at nothing for a Hollywood ending to their career. In the case of 13-year NBA veteran Baron Davis, the final scene in his hoops screenplay was akin to a horror film.

On May 6, 2012, Davis was the starting point guard for the New York Knicks as they faced the Miami Heat in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series. Midway through the third quarter of that game, Baron raced full court for a layup, planted his right foot. That's when his knee gave out and the proverbial credits began to roll on his career.

"When I got hurt and I was laying there it was pretty much like my whole career flashed before my eyes," Davis, a former two-time All-Star, said. "As I was laying there, I was like 'you know what, this is it. Just think about every day you wake up you'll never play basketball, ever again.' "

After Dark: Baron Davis Rick catches up with Baron Davis as they look back on his career and ahead to his various film projects.

The-then 33-year-old floor general was logging heavy minutes for an injury-riddled team facing elimination. In that fateful Game 4, he suffered a torn ACL, MCL and a partially torn patellar tendon, all of which came as no surprise to the veteran. But it didn't make the transition to life after basketball any easier.

"I wasn't happy at all. It's almost like that part in the movie where it finally clicks." Davis said. "[Iman] Shumpert had just tore his ACL and I was like 'look, man, no matter what happens after the season, me and you, we're going to work out, I'm going to get right. I'm going to get you right.' It's like I got my motivation back for wanting to do it. Then literally the next game (two days later) I'm carried off on a stretcher."

Davis swapped out his sneakers for a potential role as the most interesting former basketball player in the world. While rehabbing with the Knicks, he served as a correspondent for "Knickstape", an MSG Network series. It allowed him to stay involved with basketball and around the team. From there, he served as a guest analyst with NBA TV, created a Funny or Die series with fellow aspiring filmmaker Steve Nash and even took a few classes taught by Spike Lee.

Career Top 10 Plays: Baron Davis A look back at the ten best plays of Baron Davis' career.

Baron's schedule kept him occupied but far from satisfied with how his career came to an abrupt end. As his road to recovery continued, the occasional pick-up game he'd play in would net rave reviews from friends. Despite many encouraging him to return to the NBA, he still wasn't convinced.

Last summer, Davis participated in the Drew League held in his hometown of South Central Los Angeles. There he competed with the likes of Houston Rockets guard James Harden, Los Angeles Lakers forward Nick Young and Toronto Raptors All-Star guard (and fellow South Central L.A. native) DeMar DeRozan. Although Davis lacked confidence in his game, his former NBA peers thought otherwise.

"I remember after one game [Golden State Warriors guard] Klay Thompson came up to me and was like 'damn dog you still got it!' " Davis said. "DeMar DeRozan was like 'man, big bro, you still got it!' But I was like, I do? I wanted to play just to be out there with them because I was thinking I'll probably never be able to get on a NBA court with them."

... I think the ending of the movie is me on the court at the scorer's table checking in and actually getting on the court and allowing me to re-write a different chapter in the later years of my career. – Former NBA All-Star Baron Davis

Maybe not, but an athlete's career can have as many twists as a Quentin Tarantino film. Davis continued training everyday over a three month span. He went from playing one-on-one full court to two-on-two full court and eventually pickup games with NBA guys before they departed for training camp.

As Baron's confidence grew in his game, the more he began to be happy with his health and content with the thought that he may never play again. That was until the NBA D-League became a possibility.

"When the D-League called I was prepared for nobody to call. I was actually at peace with that," Davis said. "I thought at least I put myself out there and took a chance."

March 2, 2016, Baron signed with the Delaware 87ers, the Philadelphia 76ers' D-League affiliate. In his first professional game in nearly four years, Davis had eight points, four assists, a dunk as well as a no-look alley-oop pass and a 30-foot 3-pointer. While that is far from an award-winning performance, it was a step in the right direction. Davis felt good after his debut, but couldn't help but notice his status now as an elder statesman.

"I didn't realize how young the dudes were," said Davis, 36. Then [Iowa Energy Guard] Traevon Jackson came up to me and was like 'Yo man I watched you growing up!' and we're having a conversation at halftime and then he was like 'yeah my dad is Jim Jackson', and I damn near passed out."

Through three games with the 87ers, Davis has averaged 14.3 points, is shooting 41.7 percent overall and 36.4 percent on 3-pointers -- not too bad considering his four-year hiatus. Despite a minor setback with a calf strain, he feels his body is getting stronger and quicker each day. With continued improvement, he feels his career may at last get its Hollywood ending.

GameTime: Baron Davis The GameTime crew talks about their thoughts on the comeback of Baron Davis.

"I think about Grant Hill and think about all the things he went through," Davis said. "How he was able to come back from being out for two years and actually finishing at a high level and walk off on his own terms. So for me, I actually feel like it's not just one year I got left but at least three years of playing at a great level -- coming off the bench of course."

"Obviously who wouldn't want to win a championship or get back into the playoffs or just get on a roster? But I think the ending of the movie is me on the court at the scorer's table checking in and actually getting on the court and allowing me to re-write a different chapter in the later years of my career."
fd366a88-4c3f-43b3-9e8f-9ef04adac4cb  Celtics vs. Raptors (7:30 ET, NBA TV)

Playoff Implications

Every game matters with less than a month left in the regular season. The Toronto Raptors have designs on taking the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference from the Cleveland Cavaliers, but can't seem to get closer to them than their current two-game distance. The Raptors have won 11 of their last 14 games, but over their next seven games, they face three teams (Celtics, Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder) who are also trying to make noise in the playoff chase, too. As for the Celtics, they have lost three in a row and four of their last five games. Boston allowed 130 points in its Wednesday loss to the Thunder, the most it has allowed in a non-overtime game this season. Despite those struggles, the Celtics are tied with the Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat record-wise (39-29) and all three teams sit a ½-game behind the No. 3-seeded Atlanta Hawks.

Missing Crowder

The Celtics enter tonight's matchup riding a three-game losing streak that started at the hands of the Houston Rockets on March 11. In that game, forward Jae Crowder landed badly on his left ankle during the second half and suffered a high ankle sprain that has forced him to miss the last two games. He's expected to miss at least another week, which forces the Celtics to find a way to win without a key piece of their defense. Boston has allowed 100-plus points in all three games during this losing skid. The Celtics have the fifth best defensive rating in the NBA, but will they be able to maintain that level without Crowder?

Better With The Biz

The Toronto Raptors' defensive rating has slipped since the All-Star break to 15th, but it remains in the NBA's upper crust overall (11th this season in defensive rating). However, one of the team's best-rated defensive lineups is one that features rebounder and shot-blocker Bismack Biyombo. The five-man unit of Biyombo, DeMar DeRozan, Cory Joseph, Patrick Patterson and Terrence Ross has played 201 minutes together and boasts a 92.4 defensive rating. Biyombo is in the midst of a solid season, averaging career highs in points (5.6) and rebounds (8.2) despite playing the fewest minutes since his rookie season (22.7 per game). On Thursday against the Indiana Pacers, he pulled in a career- and franchise-best 25 rebounds and became the first Toronto player with two 20-rebound games in a season. Biyombo could have another big night tonight against Boston as the Celtics rank 26th in opponent rebounds allowed (46.3).

Nightly Notable: Bismack Biyombo Bismack Biyombo scores 16 points on 5-6 shooting and has nine offensive rebounds, leading to a total of 25 boards to help Toronto top Indiana in overtime.

4c3fb787-8d35-4d69-95d3-5d208c3b0b8b  — Kevin Durant's free-agency decision may now come a few days earlier.

The NBA and NBA Players Association have agreed to shorten this summer's free-agent moratorium by five days, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. New deals struck this summer may now be signed on July 7 at 12:01 a.m., according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because neither side announced the move publicly.

Teams were informed of the decision on Thursday.

Until now, this summer's moratorium was scheduled to run through July 11, with players and teams able to execute new deals on July 12. The moratorium - which exists in large part to allow the league time to calculate the exact amount of the salary cap and luxury-tax figure for the coming season - will run from July 1-6.

Both the league and the union had to sign off on the switch, which could help both sides.

Players wanted to expedite the summer process, even having discussions about the moratorium being shorter than the now-agreed-upon five days. So this essentially becomes a one-year trial, with no decisions being made on how this will change the schedule for the summer of 2017 and beyond. The letter teams received Thursday only discussed the summer of 2016.

Teams and free agents can agree to deals during the moratorium, but nothing can be signed until it ends. By shortening the moratorium, the league and its teams will have the luxury of getting deals done more quickly - and it could help prevent a situation like the one that overshadowed free agency last summer.

DeAndre Jordan agreed during last summer's moratorium to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, then changed his mind several days later and ultimately stayed with the Los Angeles Clippers. While changes of heart like that could still occur, of course, teams probably won't complain about having the ability to get signatures on contracts more quickly going forward.

Free agency is expected to be particularly hectic this summer, with Durant headlining a list of players who could be on the move. Others who could become free agents include LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Al Horford, Pau Gasol, Mike Conley, Hassan Whiteside and DeMar DeRozan.
171e1bbb-f544-4662-9958-74fb5d900069  — Tim Hardaway Jr. is making his first start of the season for the Atlanta Hawks as Kent Bazemore is held out with a bone bruise in his right knee.

Coach Mike Budenholzer said before Thursday night's game against the Denver Nuggets he hopes Bazemore's injury is "pretty short term."

Budenholzer says Bazemore suffered the injury in a fall late in Wednesday night's win at Detroit. Budenholzer says he prefers to keep Thabo Sefolosha as a substitute who can bring defensive punch off the bench.

Hardaway, acquired from the Knicks in June, has averaged only 4.9 points in 37 games. He was mostly invisible on Atlanta's roster until January, when his playing time became more significant and consistent.
40582647-909a-43b4-a6a0-d43518ab8cdd  With Yahoo! Fantasy playoffs in full swing in many leagues, here are five waiver-wire players who look ready to contribute this weekend:

Brandon Jennings, Orlando (26 percent owned)

The veteran point guard has taken over the starting point guard role in Orlando with Elfrid Payton (elbow) injured. Since entering the starting lineup two games ago, Jennings is averaging 14.0 points on 44.4 percent shooting, 2.0 3-pointers, 7.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds in just 25.5 minutes. There are few players widely available that will tally assists at the rate of Jennings, so he's definitely worth an addition as long as Payton is out (he's currently listed as day-to-day). The Magic matchup with Cleveland on Friday and Toronto on Sunday.

Josh Richardson, Miami (22 percent owned)

The Heat rookie is getting more and more opportunities off the bench. Over his last three games, the No. 40 pick of the 2015 Draft is averaging 12.5 points on 52.9 percent shooting, 2.5 3-pointers, 3.5 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 1.5 blocks in 29.6 minutes. He does a little bit of everything and could be a great plug-and-play option this weekend if you want to pad all your stat categories without hurting your field goal percentage or turnover categories. The Heat host LeBron James and the Cavaliers on Saturday.

Michael Beasley, Houston (15 percent owned)

Consistency has always been an issue for Beasley and you never know when a stretch of strong play will quickly end. All that said, Beasley has been solid for the Rockets over the last four games after they signed him at the beginning of March. Over this four-game span, the former No. 2 overall pick is averaging 15.0 points on 54.2 percent shooting, 6.8 rebounds and 1.0 steals in just 19.0 minutes of action. He's taking a ton of shots (12.0 per game) in those limited minutes, so he can still produce enough points to be worthy of an addition if you need scoring. He's a risky pickup, but he could be a difference maker for your squad if he tallies another 18-point, eight-rebound line like he did last Friday against the Celtics. The Rockets matchup with Minnesota on Friday and Atlanta on Saturday.

Bobby Portis, Chicago (13 percent owned)

The Bulls rookie started the second half of their game against the Wizards on Wednesday after starter Taj Gibson went down with a hamstring injury. Gibson is listed as questionable for Thursday and will be day-to-day all weekend, which opens up the door for Portis to see some solid action. Over his last two games, Portis is averaging 7.0 points on 42.9 percent shooting, 1.0 3-pointers, 6.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 23.8 minutes. These certainly aren't earth-shattering numbers. But they're solid for a one day addition if Gibson is out, which should allow Portis to hover around the 30-minute mark. Give him a look if you need rebounds this weekend. The Bulls matchup with Utah on Saturday.

Channing Frye, Cleveland (7 percent owned)

The veteran sharp-shooter is starting to carve out a role with the Cavaliers and his role could continue to grow as the regular season winds down. Over his last four games, Frye is averaging 14.3 points on 67.7 percent shooting, 3.5 3-pointers, 4.8 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 20.4 minutes. He likely won't shoot at such a high percentage for long. But he should still be able to provide a solid amount of 3-pointers if you need to boost that category this weekend. The Cavaliers matchup against Frye's former team Orlando on Friday and Miami on Saturday.

Stat Line Of The Week

Nightly Notable: Bojan Bogdanovic Bojan Bogdanovic scores 44 points on 17-27 shooting with four triples and eight rebounds to lead Brooklyn over Philadelphia.

March 15 vs. Philadelphia -- career-high 44 points (17-for 27 FG, 4-for-9 3P, 6-for-7 FT), 8 rebounds, 2 assists in 37 minutes

d7d91f91-95a3-425b-a067-0d063b0a8677  — Mavericks forward Jeremy Evans is out for the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.

Evans was limited to 30 games, including two starts, and the 2012 slam dunk champion played sparingly after he was reported to be battling shoulder soreness in January.

The 28-year-old Evans averaged 2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds while playing 8 minutes per game. His career averages are 3.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.

Evans signed with the Mavericks in the offseason after spending his first five years with Utah, which drafted him late in the second round in 2010.
3afdb605-b48c-4471-a941-b3decc5c6f68  Blazers vs. Spurs (8:30 ET, NBA TV)

Finding His Groove

Former Trail Blazer and prized offseason acquisition LaMarcus Aldridge has improved every month during his first season with the Spurs. In March, Aldridge is averaging 24.0 points on 57 percent shooting and 94 percent from the line, 8.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks. These numbers are miles ahead of his first full month in San Antonio when he averaged 15.9 points on 44.3 percent shooting, eight rebounds and a block. He will look to continue his dominant play in March tonight against his former team, who he scored just six points against in their most recent matchup in mid-November. Expect a much stronger performance from the five-time All-Star tonight.

GameTime: LaMarcus Aldridge Feature Check out this feature on the Spurs' All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge.

Playoff Implications

Every game is critical for the Blazers with only 14 remaining over the final three-plus weeks of the regular season. Portland is the Western Conference's No. 6 seed, four games behind Memphis for No. 5 and only one game ahead of Houston and Dallas (who are both 34-34, but are seeded No. 7 and 8, respectively). Earlier this month, it looked like the streaking Blazers could have a chance to catch the injury-riddled Grizzlies for the No. 5 seed. But a stretch of five losses in seven games has derailed those hopes for Portland and caused some to worry it could fall out of the playoffs entirely if Utah (2½ games behind Portland) catches fire over the final few weeks. A win in San Antonio to snap the Spurs' home win streak would do a lot to help Portland turn its ship around. Speaking of that home win streak ...

Perfect At Home

The Spurs have won 42 straight games at home in San Antonio dating back to last season and have started the 2015-16 season 33-0 at home. This is the third longest undefeated start to a season at home, trailing the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (37-0) and 1995-96 Orlando Magic (33-0). The Warriors are on the Spurs' tails with a 32-0 home record this season, and it's possible we could witness the first two 41-0 undefeated home records in NBA history. The Blazers head into town fresh off of two days rest, which should help as they are 8-2 this season in games after two days rest. The Spurs are 2-0 against Portland this season with an average margin of victory of 12.5 points. However, the teams haven't played since mid-November.

Elite Duo

The Blazers' backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum is the third highest scoring backcourt in the NBA (behind Stephen Curry-Klay Thompson in Golden State and Kyle Lowry-DeMar DeRozan in Toronto). Lillard and McCollum combine to average 46.4 points, 11 assists and 7.6 rebounds, with Lillard's 25.7 points per game leading the way (fifth highest in the NBA). Lillard, who has four games of 40-plus points and two games of 50-plus this season, is one of the league's most exciting players and is reason enough to watch when he plays. Will he and McCollum be able to power past the mighty Spurs and halt their historical home win streak tonight?

a581c1de-ff9e-4624-9a4d-d1ed9894a7c1  — Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose is going to be back in action against the Washington Wizards after missing two games with a strained left groin.

Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said before Wednesday night's game that the team will "keep a close eye" on Rose and "monitor him at all the timeouts" to make sure he is OK.

Rose sat out a loss against Miami last Friday, and a win against Toronto on Monday.

Hoiberg also said Pau Gasol "most likely will not play" against visiting Brooklyn on Thursday. Hoiberg says "swelling has gone down significantly but he still has a little bit of pain in his knee."
d87cfca4-cbb2-46ce-827c-f4b5777d724b  — The Cavaliers are using a pit stop at home to give LeBron James some rest.

The superstar will sit out Wednesday night's game against Dallas, part of coach Tyronn Lue's plans to give James some time off before the NBA playoffs begin next month.

Lue announced the decision not to play James about 90 minutes before the tipoff against the Mavericks. The Cavs are 0-2 without James this season and 3-12 when he doesn't play over the past two seasons.

"We definitely have to speak about that tonight, just being professional, as always, and we got to start playing better when LeBron doesn't play," Lue said. "So, guys have to step up and be ready to play and take on this challenge."

Lue chose to sit James following the team's four-game road trip, which ended on Monday at Utah. The Cavs went 3-1 on the trip before traveling back to Cleveland on Tuesday. After hosting Dallas, the Cavs will visit Orlando and Miami later this week and Lue said he intends to play James in both games.

James sat out Cleveland's Dec. 5 visit to South Florida and the Cavs were beaten 99-84 by the Heat, but the game wasn't that close. James was on the bench on Feb. 28, when the Cavs fell behind at Washington by 30 points before losing by 14.

"I just thought giving him the three days now would be good instead of just resting him one game or one day on the back-to-back," Lue explained.

James is averaging 24.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 6.5 assists. Iman Shumpert will start in place of James along with Kyrie Irving, J.R. Smith, Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love.

Without James on the floor, Irving and Love will have to pick up the slack for Cleveland's offense.

"With LeBron out you lose 25 points," Lue said. "And everyone else has to step up and also be great offensively but we're going to go through Kyrie and through Kevin and they have to produce for us."

Cleveland has a two-game lead over Toronto for the best record in the Eastern Conference.
7f678fb7-46fa-4606-a3ba-32ebd2e5d490  — The Los Angeles Clippers have signed forward Jeff Ayres for the rest of the season.

Ayers has appeared in five games this season, averaging 1.2 points and 0.6 rebounds in 2.8 minutes. He signed the first of two consecutive 10-day contacts with the team on Jan. 28.

The 28-year-old forward was a member of the Spurs' 2014 NBA championship team. His other NBA stints include Portland and Indiana.

Ayres most recently played for the Los Angeles D-Fenders in the NBA's D-League, where he was named an All-Star this season. He also played for the league's Idaho entry.

The move was announced Wednesday.
03857fb1-2ce9-4abe-9198-1165debb4460  — LaMarcus Aldridge's union with the Spurs last summer was something rarely seen in San Antonio, a big-money free agent being pursued by a franchise that prides itself on not having to chase anyone during the annual bonanza.

Armed with a rising young star in Kawhi Leonard and three ageless veterans who have won four championships together but need help now more than ever, the Spurs deviated from that long-held plan and went after the premier name on the market.

When Aldridge chose them, everyone expected the assimilation to take time for both sides. And as the playoffs near, it should come as no surprise that the player and the team are starting to find a groove.

"It takes time," said guard Manu Ginobili, who along with Tony Parker and Tim Duncan are the mainstays that the Spurs have built around for more than a decade. "Many times before we added role players, so they've just got to adjust to us and they'll figure it out or not.

"With him it's different because we've got to adjust to him, too, along with him adjusting to us. We've just got to know him, we've got to make him feel good, important. And, of course, he's so talented."

Aldridge's averages in points (17.7), field goal attempts (14.0) and minutes (30.4) are the lowest since his rookie season in 2006-07. But he is having one of the most efficient seasons of his career in Gregg Popovich's ball-sharing offense.

And while his numbers have been down compared to where they were as a featured player in Portland, they have spiked over the last month. Over his last 21 games, Aldridge is averaging 21.6 points on 55 percent shooting to help the Spurs (57-10) stay on Golden State's heels in the West with another showdown coming this weekend.

"I think it's been a mutual effort from Coach Pop and all the veterans and LaMarcus to step to each other," Spurs assistant Ettore Messina said. "Nobody rushed him. There was a lot of step-by-step attitude. Every day he feels more comfortable and guys know where to find him, where are his sweet spots. He's also giving us a defensive presence that most of the times goes underrated."

Perhaps even more telling, Aldridge has played at least 34 minutes six times in the last 12 games on a team that likes to keep everyone under 30 minutes per game and only has had one of the rest days that Popovich likes to give his veterans to keep them fresh for the playoffs.

"Before this little stretch I was playing 28-29 minutes," Aldridge said. "I'm actually enjoying the 36, 37-minute nights. That's what I like to do out there."

This 21-game surge for Aldridge comes after a four-game stretch in which his failed to reach double digits in scoring three times, unheard of for a player so used to being the focal point of the offense during nine seasons with the Trail Blazers.

"I think everybody's been welcoming to everybody else," Aldridge said. "There hasn't been any rushing or any pressure on anyone to play at a certain level. That's been good for us all."

The Spurs are 33-0 at home heading into Thursday's game against his old team, which has been one of the surprises in the league this year as GM Neil Olshey, coach Terry Stotts and star Damian Lillard have helped the Blazers avoid the long rebuild that often comes with a star player's exit.

After a period of adjustment, and right on time, the Spurs and Aldridge are putting it all together as well.

"He draws so much attention," Ginobili said. "And everybody is so concerned about him that it opens up space for everybody else. He's been an amazing addition."
203e1f64-166d-4cfb-8f0a-03ee041565a4  — The Milwaukee Bucks have used the NBA's hardship exception to sign guard Jared Cunningham to a 10-day contract, an addition that replenishes the team's injury-ravaged backcourt.

General manager John Hammond announced the signing on Wednesday. Cunningham most recently played for Idaho in the NBA Developmental League.

The 6-foot-4 Cunningham also appeared in 40 games this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging 2.6 points in 8.9 minutes a game before being traded on Feb. 18 to Orlando, where he was waived.

Cunningham was drafted in 2012 in the first round with the 24th pick by the Cavaliers out of Oregon State.

The Bucks have lost guards Michael Carter-Williams and O.J. Mayo to season-ending injuries in recent weeks. Guard Greivis Vasquez hasn't played since late November following right ankle surgery.
a84e2c36-bde5-4603-88b7-69887e7e7efa  — Former Arizona star and NBA Rookie of the Year Damon Stoudamire has been hired as the new coach at Pacific.

Athletic director Ted Leland announced Wednesday that he had hired Stoudamire to fill the vacancy. Coach Ron Verlin was suspended by the school in December stemming from an investigation into academic misconduct. Pacific announced last month that Verlin would not return and Stoudamire replaces interim coach Mike Burns.

Stoudamire spent the past seven years as an assistant coach with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies and in college at Arizona and most recently Memphis. After a stellar four-year college career at Arizona, Stoudamire played 13 seasons in the NBA with Toronto, Portland, Memphis and San Antonio.
9279fb8b-cfdd-496f-bc82-6ea89f4aa200  — The Detroit Pistons are entering the home stretch in more ways than one.

With a playoff spot now a realistic possibility, Detroit will play its next nine games at the Palace, the longest homestand in franchise history. The Pistons don't have another road game until April 2 at Chicago. By then, they hope to have taken a big step toward their first postseason berth since 2009.

"I don't think I've ever had this long of a stretch at home," said forward Anthony Tolliver, an eight-year NBA veteran.

This is the longest homestand for any NBA team this season, although it's not that unusual. The Los Angeles Clippers played nine straight home games last season, according to STATS.

Detroit (34-33) is one percentage point behind Chicago (33-32) in the race for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Pistons are 19-11 at home so far this season.

"We wanted to have a bigger cushion in this race," rookie Stanley Johnson said. "We put a tough bargain on ourselves."

The homestand begins Wednesday night against Atlanta, then come four straight teams with losing records - Sacramento, Brooklyn, Milwaukee and Orlando. The stretch ends with three tougher opponents - the Hawks again, followed by Oklahoma City and Dallas.

Four of Detroit's last six games of the regular season will be on the road, so the time to make a move in the standings is now. The Bulls play nine of their final 17 games on the road.

One person who isn't taking anything in the upcoming stretch for granted is Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy, who was still miffed Tuesday about his team's 43-point loss at Washington on Monday night.

"I've never had a team have a performance like that," he said of the game, in which the Pistons turned the ball over 21 times.

The Pistons practiced Tuesday, and the homestand will allow an easier schedule between games, since the team doesn't have to worry about travel. But Van Gundy said that's the only real advantage to being back home.

"Practice is easier, a little bit," Van Gundy said. "But other than that, nothing. Like we just said at the end - having nine straight home games means nothing if you're not going to bring great energy and effort."

The Pistons have played six of their last seven games on the road, and appeared to be in good shape after a win at Dallas last Wednesday. Then, they lost by 15 to Charlotte, had to rally past woeful Philadelphia and were routed by the Wizards.

"Our starts of games were pretty consistent the last three games. We weren't ready to play at the beginning of any of them," Van Gundy said. "We're coming with no focus, just throwing the ball around. What we've done at the beginning of the last three games has been very unprofessional."

But Detroit has an immediate chance to make up lost ground - as well as to make or break its playoff pursuit.

"It does take a toll on your body, traveling that much," Tolliver said. "Every team goes through that, so it's never an excuse to lose a game or anything like that, but it's definitely nice to be able to settle in and eat home-cooked food and get into your rhythm and the things that you want to do - be able to come shoot when you want to shoot, all those types of things."

4c3c9689-4dc3-457d-88d7-65fbdd2d941f  — A telethon to help Flint residents amid the Michigan city's crisis with lead-tainted water coupled with a match from Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores has raised more than $1.1 million.

The Flint native said he would match up to $1 million in donations made during Tuesday's telethon hosted by Detroit television station WDIV-TV. Organizers say the event drew more than 1,500 donations totaling $566,982. With Gores' match, that brings the total to $1,133,964.

The telethon, called "Flint Water Crisis: 4 Our Families ((hash)FlintKids)," benefits the Community Foundation of Greater Flint and its Flint Child Health and Development Fund.

If consumed, lead can cause developmental delays and learning disabilities. There are a number of efforts taking place to boost Flint education, health and support programs.

Gores earlier pledged to raise $10 million to help the city.
2c502c04-be3a-4d44-9dce-81625dc7a71e  Clippers vs. Spurs (8:30 ET, NBA TV)

Perfect At Home

The Spurs have won 41 straight games at home in San Antonio dating back to last season and have started the 2015-16 season a perfect 32-0 at home. This is the third longest undefeated start to a season at home, trailing the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (37-0) and 1995-96 Orlando Magic (33-0). The Warriors are on the Spurs' tails with a 31-0 home record this season, and it's possible we could witness the first two 41-0 undefeated home records in NBA history. The Clippers are one of four teams in the league to have more than 20 road wins this season (joining Golden State, San Antonio and Cleveland), so they're in a better position than most to halt the Spurs' historic streak. It won't be easy, though, as the Spurs have won at home by an average of 15.4 points this season.

Filling The Void

It's getting harder and harder for the Clippers to win against elite teams without Blake Griffin, who has been out since Christmas due to injuries. Los Angeles won its first nine games without Griffin, but have posted a record of 16-10 since that stretch. They are 2-3 over their last five games with losses against Cleveland, Oklahoma City and Atlanta. Chris Paul has carried a heavy load over this stretch without Griffin as he's averaged 21.4 points and 12.1 assists over his last 10 games (including nine double-doubles). The Clippers will need a big offensive game from Paul, along with solid contributions from Jeff Green, Jamal Crawford, Wesley Johnson or Luc Mbah A Moute. In their loss to the Cavaliers on Sunday, those four bench contributors scored just 28 points on 10-for-39 shooting. The Clippers' bench must perform better than that if they hope to knock off the Spurs, who have won 11 of their last 12 games.

Sharp Shooters

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson may get all the hype, but the top two 3-point shooters in the league are on the Clippers and Spurs. J.J. Redick leads the league from deep at 47.8 percent, while Kawhi Leonard sits in second with a career-best clip of 46.5 percent. The Spurs have struggled mightily from deep over their last four games, however, shooting a combined 18-for-88 (20.5 percent). This is way below their season average of 38.1 percent, which is second best in the league. San Antonio will look to regain their shooting stroke at home tonight as they look to improve to 52-0 this season when shooting a higher field goal percentage than their opponent.

Playoff Rematch

The most obvious reason to watch of them all. The Clippers and Spurs competed in one of the most exciting playoff series in NBA history last season, with the Clippers prevailing in seven games. Relive all the action from that series before tonight's Fan Night coverage begins at 8 ET on NBA TV:

dfa4b6fa-0eda-43dd-a37e-4f3d981c698d  — Wizards guard Bradley Beal is in the starting lineup for Washington's game against the Detroit Pistons.

His return Monday night comes after missing three games with a sprained pelvis, the latest setback in an injury-filled season.

Beal also missed a stretch of 16 games in December and January with a stress reaction in his right leg. The fourth-year guard is averaging 17.8 points per game and is the Wizards' second-leading scorer.

Washington enters Monday in 10th place in the Eastern Conference, 3 1/2 games behind Detroit for the conference's eighth and final playoff spot.
18202a80-190b-4480-a03e-1f5912c1780a  — Chris Bosh returned to the Miami Heat bench on Monday night, his first appearance since being sidelined by a blood clot last month.

Bosh was dressed in a gray sport coat and took a seat toward the end of the bench for a game against the Denver Nuggets. It was Bosh's first time being seen at AmericanAirlines Arena since Feb. 9, Miami's last home game before the All-Star break.

Bosh withdrew from the All-Star festivities in Toronto because of what was called a calf strain. It was later learned that he had a clot, the same problem that ended his season early a year ago.

Bosh released a statement last week saying he no longer has a clot in his leg. It's unknown if he can play again this season.
95397e26-49ed-4a26-9fa2-210b4068e99f  — The Utah Jazz have announced that forward Gordon Hayward will not play Monday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers due to plantar fasciitis in his right foot.

Hayward's status is officially day-to-day.

Hayward leads the team with averages of 20.1 points, 3.7 assists and 36.2 minutes per game. He also averages 4.9 rebounds per game.

The Jazz have been decimated by injuries this season with Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors both missing long stretches. Alec Burks is still recovering from a broken fibula and Dante Exum missed the entire season with a torn ACL.

The Jazz (31-35) are currently two games behind the Dallas Mavericks in the race for the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference.
4ba6da6b-b599-4ab1-a1b6-f9af68ec3c67  — The following is a medical update on Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward, who has been suffering from plantar fasciitis in his right foot:

In consultation with the Jazz medical staff, it has been determined that the best course of action is for Hayward to undergo a period of treatment and rehabilitation. As a result, he will not to play in tonight's game vs. Cleveland. He is considered day-to-day, and further updates will be provided when appropriate.

Hayward (6-8, 225, Butler) has appeared in all 66 Jazz games this season (all starts), and leads the team in scoring (20.1) and assists (3.7), while adding 4.9 rebounds in a team-high 36.2 minutes per game. He is one of just four players in the NBA averaging at least 20.0 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting at least 35.0 percent from behind the three-point line. The 25-year-old career Jazzman was originally selected by Utah in the first round (ninth overall selection) of the 2010 NBA Draft.
dbb0e5cf-18f6-455a-bf4e-4b6a37b95e26  — The Charlotte Hornets' Kemba Walker and the Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry today were named NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for games played Monday, March 7 through Sunday, March 13.

Walker helped the Hornets to a 4-0 week with averages of 27.8 points (second in the Eastern Conference), 6.8 assists (10th in the conference) and 5.0 rebounds. He recorded two games with at least 30 points and dished out six or more assists in all four contests. Walker connected on 16-of-31 (51.6 percent) three-point field goals for the week. On March 12, Walker posted 26 points, six assists and five rebounds as the Hornets recorded their seventh straight win, a 125-109 victory over the Houston Rockets.

Curry led the Warriors to a 4-0 week behind averages of 30.5 points (third in the Western Conference), 5.8 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 2.25 steals (sixth in the conference). He connected on 24-of-52 (46.2 percent) from beyond the arc, adding to his NBA-record tally of three-point makes in a season, which currently stands at 318. Curry recorded two double-doubles, including his 41-point, 13-rebound effort during Golden State's 119-113 win over the Orlando Magic on March 7.

1f73546c-f38e-458f-920d-d120a7003474  — Chesapeake Energy founder Aubrey McClendon had the gas pedal floored in his SUV until just before it slammed into a bridge support at 78 mph, and it doesn't seem he tried to avoid the deadly crash, authorities said Monday.

McClendon tapped his breaks before impact, but not enough to slow his vehicle significantly, police Chief Bill Citty said at a news conference. There was no evidence that McClendon tried to veer away before impact.

Citty wouldn't say whether he thinks the former Chesapeake CEO intended to crash or had full control of his Chevrolet Tahoe.

"We're not going to speculate. We don't know what was going through his mind at the time. We don't know what was going on in the cab of that vehicle," Citty said.

McClendon died March 2, a day after a federal grand jury indicted him on a bid-rigging charge. The part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder had vowed to fight the accusation.

The vehicle's data recorder showed that McClendon was driving 88 mph and then tapped his brakes, but not enough to significantly reduce speed. The brakes were fully operative, Citty said.

McClendon had his gas pedal floored until 1 1/2 seconds before impact, when he reduced it from 99 to 25 percent depressed, the police chief said.

Investigators found tire tracks but no skid marks. Police are checking McClendon's cellphone records to determine if he was on the phone.

The medical examiner's office said previously that McClendon died from multiple blunt force trauma, but it has yet to reveal the official manner of death or the toxicology test results, which usually take 4-6 weeks to complete.

The Tahoe simmered after the collision before it caught on fire, a witness told police.

Medical examiners identified McClendon's body using dental records, spokeswoman Amy Elliott said.

A federal grand jury indicted McClendon on March 1, alleging he conspired to rig the bidding process for natural gas leases in Oklahoma from 2007 to 2012, when he led Chesapeake Energy.

In the charging document, prosecutors alleged that McClendon, two unnamed companies and an unnamed co-conspirator would decide who would win the bid to certain drilling rights and then give the "loser" a share in the lease.

McClendon said shortly after being indicted that he was the first person in the oil and gas industry to be accused of improprieties involving the joint bidding on leases, in which companies work together to solicit work.

He died the next morning after his SUV hit a support beneath Interstate 44, the Turner Turnpike, in northeastern Oklahoma City.

McClendon founded Chesapeake Energy with Tom Ward in 1989. Ward later left and formed SandRidge Energy Corp., which has disclosed it was subpoenaed amid an investigation into the awarding of land or mineral rights from the same time period covered in the McClendon indictment.

Prosecutors have not identified SandRidge as one of the unnamed companies from the indictment. Separately, Sandridge has said the Justice Department told the company it was the target of a separate Oklahoma federal grand jury investigation.

McClendon resigned as CEO at Chesapeake in 2013 after a revolt by activist shareholders including Carl Icahn. He started a new company, American Energy Partners, less than a mile from Chesapeake's headquarters in Oklahoma City. SandRidge investors ousted Ward the same year after a proxy fight; he later formed Tapstone Energy.
f470e30e-4f2b-494d-850d-e3d8762832f8  — Forward Axel Toupane has signed a second 10-day contract with the Denver Nuggets.

Toupane (pronounced tu-PON) averaged 4.6 points and 1.0 assist in 13.4 minutes over five games during his first 10-day contract.

The 23-year-old native of France previously played for Toronto 905 of the NBA D-League this season, averaging 14.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.6 assists and a steal in 32 games.
8fc07329-f317-4b65-963a-d35364c45e8a  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

ac541da0-1534-4543-a4c2-2ceee890ba6a  — The Los Angeles Clippers say Blake Griffin has been medically cleared to return to the team and will immediately begin serving a four-game suspension for punching their assistant equipment manager.

Griffin, who has not played since December, practiced with the Clippers on Saturday. He was cleared by the team's doctor before Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets.

He will sit out that game, along with games against Boston, Minnesota and Oklahoma City for punching Matias Testi in January.

Griffin's absence has been the result of a partially torn tendon in his left quad and a broken hand requiring surgery that he suffered in the incident with Testi in Toronto.

Griffin becomes eligible to play again on April 3 against Washington.

He is averaging 23.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists in 30 games this season.
dc0164e5-b161-479b-b826-1aa091d08d39  — The L.A. Clippers announced today that forward Blake Griffin has been medically cleared for all basketball activities and will begin serving his four-game, team-imposed suspension on Sunday, March 27 when the Clippers play the Denver Nuggets.

Griffin has missed the last 41 games with a partially torn left quad tendon and right hand fracture, and will return to action on Sunday, April 3 against the Washington Wizards.

In his 30 games this season, Griffin is averaging 23.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists in 34.9 minutes
8b7d0025-8472-4da0-9dfc-8cf354daffad  — Blake Griffin is back on the practice court.

The Clippers power forward still needs to be activated before he can begin his four-game suspension, but after missing 41 games with quad and hand injuries, Griffin joined his teammates for practice for the first time Saturday since getting medically cleared.

"We're not going to do much contact anyways," said head coach Doc Rivers. "He's just going to go and see what he can do and go from there."

Rivers said Griffin had been cleared "for a while," but he still needed time to build up his quad to the

point he could practice. That point is now, and when Griffin, Rivers and the Clippers believe he's ready to play in a game, he'll then be activated.

At that point, Griffin can start his suspension.

"I don't know if one practice is enough to activate him," Rivers said. "We've got to activate him when we think he's ready to play."

Whether or not Griffin is activated before Sunday's game against the Nuggets, the news is obviously positive, particularly considering the tone earlier in the week.

Just a few days ago, Rivers said he felt like Griffin would be back before the playoffs but couldn't say that "with 100 percent certainty." When asked if there was any concern he could miss the rest of the season, Rivers said he didn't think that would happen but that there was a chance.

By Saturday, all that had changed. Rivers said he's seen plenty of Griffin's workout over the last month, and his movement has gotten considerably better. Now, the Clippers will need to continue to watch and monitor Griffin as he works his way back in practices.

Rivers said he won't be excited until Griffin is back in the lineup for a game, but it's an obvious stepping stone to that point. Rivers said he's not sure what's a morale boost and what isn't, but he has to believe it'll be nice mentally for his players to see Griffin back on the court.

"We can start, kind of, putting our playoff stuff in," Rivers said. "Now, even if he doesn't play right away, at least we can work on it. That'll help us."

The Clippers will still need to play at least their next few games without Griffin, and thus far they've managed to put together a 27-14 record without their star forward, better than many anticipated.

"If you would've told me that was our record, I would've signed on the line right away," Rivers said.

To make up for Griffin's absence, the Clippers received increased play from just about everyone on both units. But as Rivers pointed out, every game without Griffin is "still in survival mode."

"Every game is a single game, and that's how guys have viewed it," Rivers said. "I just think as it's gone on, it's gotten harder and harder, because it takes a lot of energy to win games. I don't think the average person respects winning one game in the NBA, how much goes into it. It's hard."

That became more evident this month, as the level of competition increased in March. After going 11-3 in January and 7-4 in February, the Clippers started March 5-7, including a 1-4 road trip against some of the top teams in the West before returning home to beat the Trail Blazers on a buzzer-beater Thursday.

Rivers said perhaps more than anything, the Clippers have missed Griffin's ability to stop a run as they looked for players other than Chris Paul to make a play.

"We've scored the same for the most part, but it's definitely been harder without him, more his passing than his actual scoring," Rivers said. "I don't think it'll be hard, but it's different. Anything different upsets your tempo a little bit, so it'll be different."

What should help Griffin and the Clippers is his familiarity with the offense and with Paul, DeAndre Jordan and J.J. Redick as he works his way back on the floor.

Rivers said he'd prefer Griffin could get 20 games before the playoff, but he knows that's no longer realistic with 11 games left in the regular season.

Now, Griffin will get on the floor whenever he's ready.

"I don't care if it's zero (games), to be honest, now, as long as he's playing to start the playoffs," Rivers said. "Is that an ideal way of going into a playoff series? No, but I'd rather have him than not. That's the way I look at it."
8958bd20-9b5b-4d2b-b80a-da24ea3e8218  — Kyrie Irving will miss Cleveland's game against the New York Knicks to rest.

Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said the point guard would sit out at the team's morning shootaround Saturday. He also says Mo Williams could return from a left knee injury but a decision wouldn't be made until after the guard warmed up.

Lue recently said he would try to find opportunities for players to rest before the playoffs with the Cavs having already wrapped up the Central Division title. Irving has played in 46 games, all starts, since returning from a broken kneecap sustained during last year's NBA Finals.

An ailing knee has ended a certain Spaniard's seven-week run as king of the mountain. Now let's see if a certain German can fend off all challengers.

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies are again making their presence felt and a big man returns to the race for the first time since Week 7.

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 24. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 3 games, 28.3 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 3.7 apg

Season stats: 18.8 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 1.8 apg

On Sunday, Nowitzki notched his first 40-point game this season and his first since Jan. 11, 2014. It was the 20th 40-point game of his illustrious career and he became the first OSPR player to eclipse the mark. He's now gone nine straight games with 20 or more points and three consecutive with eight or more rebounds. Think he can still get the job done?

Nightly Notable: Dirk Nowitzki Dirk Nowitzki records 40 points against the Blazers becoming only the 4th player in history to score 40+ pts in a game at the age of 37 or older.

2. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 2 games, 9.0 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 3.5 apg

Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 4.0 apg

Gasol played just two games last week because of continuing soreness in his knee. Monday's showing against the Kings wasn't bad (14 points, 14 rebounds), but Wednesday's effort (four points, five rebounds on 2-for-7 shooting) may have been his worst performance since that dreaded Jan. 20 game against Golden State (one point, eight rebounds).

3. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 3 games, 21. 7 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 3.3 apg

Season stats: 19.1 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.7 apg

It was a productive and efficient week for Wade, who shot better than 50 percent from the field in two of three games and 54.9 FG% overall. The solid shooting put a halt to six consecutive games of sub-50 percent, with three of those games being below 35 percent. Wade appears to be in a nice shooting groove.

4. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 9

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.3 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 5.7 apg

Season stats: 14.9 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 2.0 apg

Threatened with being bumped off the list, Randolph secured his first career triple-double (28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists) Saturday. Take that, OSPR. The rest of Z-Bo's week was decent, notching a solid double-double (14 and 13) Monday followed up the next night with an all-around effort (16 points, six rebounds, five assists, three blocks).

Randolph's 1st Triple-Double Zach Randolph recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists against the Clippers.

5. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 10.3 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 12.2 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 4.0 apg

Bland is probably the best word to describe Johnson's week. After eight straight double-figure scoring games, Johnson ended his week with back-to-back games of fewer than 10 points, shooting below 35 percent in both. Of course it's tough to score when you have just 24 FGA in three games combined.

6. Tony Allen (33), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 3 games, 20.3 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.3 apg

Season stats: 8.1 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg

Allen certainly has the scoring touch lately, managing two games of 20 or more points last week including Tuesday's impressive showing in which he went 12-for-12 from the field en route to a season-high 27 points. Allen has now scored in double figures in five straight games and eight of his last 10.

7. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 4 games, 14.5 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 13.7 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.2 apg

If not for Thursday's 25-point performance against the Blazers, Crawford would've fallen down a peg or two. That's because his three other games missed the mark. Yes, he went for double-figure scoring in two of the three, but he failed to eclipse 42 percent from the field in any of them. On the positive side, he's now hit at least two 3s in three of his last five.

8. Matt Barnes (36), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: 2 games, 10.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 9.7 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 2.0 apg

Barnes' one-game suspension seemed to have stalled his mini scoring burst. Before Saturday's ban, he had scored in double figures in three straight and five of his last six. But following Saturday, Barnes went for 12 and nine. Tuesday's game also saw Barnes fail to secure a rebound for the first time since March 4.

9. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 2 games, 18.5 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 1.5 apg

Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 3.1 apg

He may have shot poor (38.7 FG%) last week, but Bryant did manage 20 points (on 7-for-18 shooting) Tuesday for his second 20-point game in the last eight. The future Hall of Famer remains day-to-day with soreness in his right shoulder, and that will most likely be the case the rest of the season.

Inside The NBA: Kobe Bryant 5-time NBA Champion Kobe Bryant joins the Inside set after a 20-point performance leading to a win over the Grizzlies.

10. Luis Scola (35), Toronto Raptors

Last week's rank: NA

Last week's stats: 3 games, 15.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 0.7 apg

Season stats: 8.9 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 0.9 apg

It looks like Scola is turning into a big version of Steph Curry, nailing three 3-pointers in three straight games. In addition to shooting 56.3 from beyond the arc, Scola managed a healthy 56.3 clip from the field. Equally impressive was the fact the big man notched his first back-to-back double-figure scoring games since Jan. 20 and 22.

Just missed the cut: Tyson Chandler, Tony Parker, Jose Calderon

82e34248-1dbd-4dde-b691-982b91ddcff5  — Lakers rookie guard D'Angelo Russell was carried off the court Friday night after spraining his right ankle.

Russell was hurt late in the first half of Los Angeles' home game against Denver.

The Lakers say X-rays are negative on Russell, the No. 2 pick in last summer's draft. He will be re-evaluated this weekend.

Russell appeared to be making a normal defensive move when he rolled his ankle and immediately went down in pain. Jordan Clarkson and Tarik Black carried him off the court with his arms around their shoulders, unable to put weight on his foot.

The Lakers later announced Russell has a moderate sprain.

Russell is the NBA's fourth-leading scorer among rookies with 13.3 points per game, and he ranks third with 3.5 assists.
82e6f22b-164f-40a7-81d4-0f3371ffeaa2  — David Lee got one last loud ovation from the Golden State crowd.

The player who went from being the only All-Star on a losing team to a role player on a championship one was honored Friday night in his first trip back to Oracle Arena since leaving the Warriors after winning the championship last season.

Lee got a loud ovation during pregame introductions as he made his first start for Dallas against his former team. The Warriors then played a video tribute to Lee, and Stephen Curry then walked to center court to say a few words, crediting Lee for "changing the culture" around the team. Curry then presented Lee with his championship ring.

"It's very special," Lee said before the ceremony. "When we got here, we were a losing team. It's been quite a journey. To end that last year with the ultimate thing you want to accomplish in sports, to win a championship, it's great to celebrate that and enjoy it for one last time tonight."

Lee had seen a few photos of the ring that contains more than six carats of diamonds and sapphires on social media, but wanted to wait to see it in person until he got his own.

Lee was one of the centerpieces of the Warriors when he was acquired from the New York Knicks in July 2010 in a sign-and-trade deal. He became Golden State's first All-Star in 16 seasons when he made the team in 2013 and was a major part of teams that had little success.

Lee averaged 18.2 points and 10 rebounds per game his first four seasons with the Warriors, forming a solid one-two punch with Curry. Golden State won just one playoff series in that span before finally breaking through to win the championship last season when Lee's role was significantly reduced.

"When they were a struggling franchise, he was a guy who came on board here and picked them up," Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. "He was one of the transition guys between the down years and the championship. I know that's appreciated and I know people here will give him that love tonight."

Knocked out of the starting lineup by Draymond Green by an injury in preseason, Lee became a little-used reserve on the title-winning team last season. He played just 49 games - often sitting out even when healthy - and averaged just 7.9 points per game for his lowest output since his rookie season with the Knicks in 2005-06.

But Lee never complained and never became a distraction. Instead, he embraced his role and embodied the team-first spirit that propelled the Warriors to their first NBA title in 40 years.

Lee's biggest contribution on the court might've come in the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the NBA Finals in Cleveland. The Warriors' comeback fell short, but the team regained its rhythm behind Lee's pick-and-roll play and ball-movement, which had been sorely lacking in the series.

"David helped us win that championship," coach Steve Kerr said. "In a year when we asked him to take a backseat, he handled his role extremely well. He came into the finals when we really needed him and came through. I can't wait to hear the crowd cheering for him tonight. It's going to be awesome."

Lee continued to play as a reserve and the Warriors won the next three games. He also funded a trip for the entire team to Las Vegas following the championship parade, and was well-liked by coaches and teammates.

"The reason why we won a championship last year is because we did it as a team," Lee said. "There were guys who made sacrifices, there were guys who stepped up, there were guys who did big things all year long. We won it as a team and I thought the only way to celebrate it was as a team."
26fc7bc6-bda2-47b6-a2ea-a505768d2176  — Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor said Friday that he plans to keep general manager Milt Newton on through the draft and free agency before making a decision on his long-term future with the franchise.

Newton was elevated to the primary decision-maker after the death of Flip Saunders, who was both president of basketball operations and coach, shortly before the season began in October. Taylor has said all along that he wanted to evaluate both Newton and interim coach Sam Mitchell over the full season before making decisions on their fates.

But Taylor said Friday that he still needed more time to fully evaluate Newton because he wanted to give the GM the opportunity to go through a draft and free agency in July and prove to Taylor that he can execute the plan that he has put in place.

"For him, it would be tough for me to evaluate him fully because he has not had the opportunity to go through the draft and free agency," Taylor said to The Associated Press after appearing on WCCO radio earlier in the day. "I have to let him do that in order to have a chance to give him a full evaluation."

Taylor said his decision to give Newton the summer to enact his plan does not mean that he is certain to be the GM at the start of next season. Taylor said the two will sit down after free agency to see where the team is at.

"It has to do with how he goes through the process," Taylor said. "I want to see him do the work and see how he goes about using all the tools available to him."

When Saunders returned to the Timberwolves three years ago, he brought Newton to Minnesota from Washington where the two worked together and became close. Newton worked hand-in-hand with Saunders to reshape the Timberwolves roster, trading Kevin Love for a package including Andrew Wiggins, drafting Karl-Anthony Towns and bringing in veterans like Kevin Garnett, Tayshaun Prince and Andre Miller in to mentor Wiggins, Towns, Zach LaVine and Shabazz Muhammad.

Saunders died from Hodgkin's lymphoma in October, thrusting the organization into an incredibly difficult position. Mitchell was elevated from an assistant spot to coach the team and Newton was put in charge of the front office.

"We've had a good relationship," Taylor said. "He communicates very well with me very often. I think he's working hard and he's doing the right things."

Taylor said he will make a decision on Mitchell, who has led the Timberwolves to a 23-48 record heading into Friday night's game at Washington, much sooner than he will Newton. Taylor said he has a good feel for the job Mitchell has done, but wanted to see how the team finished the season first.

The Wolves struggled mightily in December and January, but have started to show signs of coming together since Feb. 1. That's when Garnett and Prince saw their minutes reduced and Mitchell employed a more up-tempo offense centered around the young players. The starting five of Ricky Rubio, LaVine, Wiggins, Towns and Gorgui Dieng has been one of the more productive units in the league over the last 25 games, and Taylor said he has been pleased with the development of his entire starting group.

"I think guys are playing better, have been more competitive and are making fewer mistakes," Taylor said.

Taylor said he was concerned with the lack of development in the bench players, but that second unit has been hurt by injuries to Garnett, Nikola Pekovic and Nemanja Bjelica and the decisions to buy out the contracts of Miller and Kevin Martin.

With a promising young core of Towns, Wiggins, LaVine and Rubio, a playoff drought that will hit 12 years this season and a fan base that has become increasingly disillusioned with the product, it's a critical summer for the Timberwolves. The decisions Taylor ultimately makes with his front office and his head coach could be make-or-break when it comes to the long-term health of the franchise.

"They are our key guys," Taylor said about the GM and coach. "It's very important."
1bfe83fb-0ae8-45d4-a7d6-ea3880e878a4  — The Dallas Mavericks announced today that forward Chandler Parsons underwent arthroscopic surgery to address an injury to his right medial meniscus. The surgery was performed by team physician Dr. Daniel Worrel at The Carrell Clinic in Dallas. Parsons will miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season.

Parsons (6-10, 230) finished the year with averages of 13.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 29.5 minutes in 61 games (51 starts). He shot 49.2 percent (320-of-651) from the field and 41.4 percent (104-of-251) from 3-point range.

Over his final 30 games of the season (since Jan. 12), Parsons averaged 18.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 34.3 minutes. He shot 52 percent (204-of-392) from the floor and 47.5 percent (75-of-158) from deep in his last 30 games.
afc5499b-bcc7-4ffc-9c6e-2f465cb7cc64  — The injury-decimated New Orleans Pelicans have received a hardship exemption from the NBA allowing them to increase their roster to 17 players and have signed forward Jordan Hamilton to a 10-day contract.

The 6-foot-7 Hamilton last played in the NBA Development League for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, averaging 14.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 14 games.

Hamilton is a former Texas Longhorns standout who was drafted 26th overall by Dallas in 2011.

Hamilton has played in the NBA in stints with Denver, Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers.

He has averaged 5.5 points and 2.6 rebounds in 12.8 minutes in 140 career NBA games.

Five Pelicans players, including All-Star forward Antony Davis, have had season-ending injuries. Three others have missed recent games with injuries sidelining them day-to-day.
f5b75b8f-6b94-40a9-983b-e755f4c00ac3  — The Denver Nuggets have agreed to a multiyear deal with Axel Toupane after seeing enough of the forward through a pair of 10-day contracts.

Toupane is averaging 3.0 points and 1.3 rebounds in 11 appearances for the Nuggets this season. Before joining Denver, the 23-year-old native of France suited up in 32 games for the Toronto 905 of the NBA D-League, where he averaged 14.6 point and 5.6 rebounds.

The 6-foot-7, 210-pound Toupane played in the French Pro National Basketball League A from 2011 to 2015.
6e981dc5-8781-4f54-8a01-ef6fcfdae167  Hornets vs. Pistons (7:30 ET, NBA TV)

Playoff Implications

Every game matters with just three weeks to go in the regular season. The Hornets have surged up the standings over the last couple weeks and enter tonight's game tied with the Miami Heat for the No. 5 seed. The Hornets have a 3 game lead over the No. 7 seed Indiana Pacers and trail the No. 3 seed Hawks by just half a game. The Pistons got a little more of a cushion in the No. 8 seed thanks to the Chicago Bulls' loss on the road to the New York Knicks. The Hornets and Pistons will come out extremely motivated with so few games in between the No. 3 and No. 9 seeds in the Eastern Conference.

All The Buzz

There's a reason the Hornets have surged up the standings over the last two months. The Spurs (21-3) and the Warriors (21-3) are the only teams to have a better record than the Hornets (19-5) since January 31. Charlotte has the third best defensive rating and the ninth best offensive rating during this span. Since the beginning of March, the Hornets have the fourth best offensive rating, which they displayed in the final three quarters of their big win over the Spurs on Monday. They're led by Kemba Walker, who has been unbelievable since the beginning of March with averages of 22.8 points on 44.9 percent shooting, 5.8 assists and 5.0 rebounds in 36.1 minutes.

Motor City Starting To Roll

Detroit has won four straight -- which matches their longest win streak of 2015-16 -- and is in the midst of a season-altering nine-game home stand. The Pistons haven't made the playoffs since 2009, but are making the most of this home stand as they're 4-1 on it so far. Much like those Pistons teams of days gone by, Detroit has been effective in locking down the opposition's top scorer. In his last three games against Detroit, Charlotte's Kemba Walker has been held to 12.3 points on 8-for-31 shooting. Detroit's offense has been great of late, too, as it is averaging 110 points, shooting 47.9 percent and 42 percent on 3-pointers over its last four games.

Return Of Linsanity?

Lin Drops 29 Points Jeremy Lin goes off for 29 points to lead the Hornets over the Spurs.

Jeremy Lin has been on a tear off the bench for the Hornets over the last week with averages of 22.0 points on 62.5 percent shooting, 4.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 28.7 minutes over his last three games. He was critical to the Hornets' comeback over the Spurs on Monday, finishing with 29 points on 11-for-18 shooting with seven rebounds. After the game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of Lin, "He was spectacular. We couldn't stop him all night. He was wonderful." Will Lin be able to continue his "wonderful" play against the Pistons tonight?

d3f37db7-6e41-4f6a-bd01-357c046a05f6  — Portland Trail Blazers forward Meyers Leonard will undergo surgery to repair his injured left shoulder and will be sidelined for the remainder of the season, the team announced today.

The surgery is scheduled to be performed on Friday, April 8 by Dr. Neal ElAttrache at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles.

A prognosis on Leonard's return will be made following the procedure.

Through 61 games this season, Leonard is averaging 8.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.
d963a14b-d47b-4627-84b1-e5377f008cbd  — The NBA says it is "deeply concerned" about a North Carolina law it views as discriminatory toward gays and says it doesn't know if it can successfully host the All-Star Game in Charlotte next season.

On Thursday, the league joined those opposing the state's "Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act," which has been criticized because it allows businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians.

In a statement, the league says the law "runs counter to our guiding principles of equality and mutual respect," adding that it does not know yet "what impact it will have on our ability to successfully host the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte."

The events are scheduled for next February, and there have already been calls for the league to move them out of North Carolina because of the law.
2b9aabfe-3562-4c4c-9e6e-13e1fcf1eb5e  — Toddler Riley Curry snuggled up under the right arm of her father's wax figure and grinned in delight.

Even if a little bit confused by it all.

"How is it, Riley, is it weird?" her dad asked. "There's two of us up here. That's probably weird to see two of us up here looking right back at her."

When Riley's baby sister, Ryan, later sat down next to her, in a matching dress and sweater no less, they glanced up and admired their superstar dad's dribbling pose.

"I don't know how you could actually dream about something like this," Curry said about seeing his likeness - and what a resemblance it is - in wax. "You look at the detail and all that goes into a wax figure, so pretty special."

Madame Tussauds unveiled his wax figure Thursday and it will be on display at the Fisherman's Wharf museum by the end of next week. A team of artists and sculptors spent nearly four months on Curry's figure, taking 250 measurements of the NBA MVP and including details down to the tattoos on his wrists.

"That is crazy," Curry said upon seeing his first view of the finished product, valued at $350,000. "I grew a little bit more facial hair before. During the season I have to shave to kind of match what it was last year. That is pretty cool. It's pretty incredible, obviously very accurate. The whole process from posing for like four, three hours at that position I got a lot of quad work while they did all the measurements."

Curry shot a selfie with his figure and posed for family photographs with his wife, two daughters and his mother. Perhaps the only thing missing: his mouth guard, which he flung in frustration for a rare technical Wednesday night in a 114-98 victory over the rival Los Angeles Clippers.

The 28-year-old Curry shared a story how one of his first dates with Ayesha was to a wax museum.

"For me and my wife, it's kind of a funny story. One of our first dates in L.A., we went to the museum on Hollywood Boulevard," Curry said. "So that was one of our first experiences together, walking through and taking pictures with all the wax figures in that museum, and now to have one of my own is pretty special."

It's spot on down to his own handwriting on the bright blue Under Armour sneakers. Curry said he was amazed each hair was placed in the wax head by hand.

The Warriors held their team photo day and Curry joked with teammates that his wax figure could stand in for him in the photo.

"He finally hit it big, he finally made it. It's official," coach Steve Kerr said. "I can't wait to see it. I think it will be cool."

The folks at Madame Tussauds invited Curry to come see his wax figure in the museum.

"The schedule's a little tight right now," Curry said, smiling. "It was a great experience all the way through. It's something I'll remember for a while, and we'll get to go see it with all the other distinguished people in the museum."
99282375-514d-4991-901c-6bac4c7c82b9  — Manu Ginobili will be available to play for Argentina's basketball team in the Rio Olympics.

The Argentine federation announced Ginobili's decision Thursday. It will be a fourth Olympics for the San Antonio Spurs star, who has led Argentina to a gold and bronze medal in three appearances.

Argentina won gold in 2004 and bronze four years later in Beijing, but lost to Russia in the third-place game in 2012. His Olympic career appeared over, but the Argentines somewhat surprisingly earned a berth in Rio last summer by reaching the final of the FIBA Americas tournament.

Ginobili didn't play on that team, but will rejoin longtime teammate Luis Scola as the Argentines play in a difficult Group B that includes Spain, Lithuania, Brazil and Nigeria.
b6f91c1d-321c-4082-932b-7916c1f4013a  — The San Antonio Spurs will be without Kawhi Leonard, fellow starter Danny Green and two key reserves against Memphis on Friday night when they attempt to match the longest home winning streak to open a season.

Leonard suffered a bruised right quadriceps midway through the third quarter of San Antonio's 112-88 victory over Miami on Wednesday night. His return is unknown, but the injury is not considered serious.

It was the Spurs' 36th straight home victory to open the season, which is one shy of matching the league record set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96.

Leonard was injured after being fouled by Heat rookie Justise Winslow on a driving layup. San Antonio's 6-foot-7, All-Star forward remained in the game to complete the three-point play and match his career high of 32 points, but exited thereafter with team trainer Will Sevening following close behind.

"He had to come out when he did because his leg was just ... it was a good contusion so it was just stiff, it wouldn't work," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "So, he had to come out. To put him back in wouldn't have made any sense."

In addition to being without Leonard, San Antonio is sitting Green and reserves Boris Diaw and Patty Mills for rest on Friday against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Popovich routinely rests his veteran players throughout the arduous, 82-game regular season to help them remain fresh and healthy for the postseason.

The Spurs were fined $250,000 by then-NBA commissioner David Stern when Popovich sent Green, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili home for rest on Nov. 29, 2012, rather than having them play Miami in the final game of a six-game road trip.

Stern said the fine was due to a litany of transgressions, but primarily because San Antonio did not alert the league or media of the players' unavailability prior to the game.

Since then, the Spurs have announced in advance which players will rest.

Being without Leonard, Green, Diaw and Mills could be troublesome Wednesday, even though the Grizzlies are without injured starters Marc Gasol and Mike Conley.

Memphis holds a four-game lead over Portland for the fifth seed in the Western Conference.

San Antonio has an 11-game lead over Oklahoma City for the West's second seed and trails Golden State by four for the top seed.

The Spurs have won 45 straight regular-season home games dating to March 2015, which matches the 1995-96 Bulls for the second-longest streak in league history and trails the Warriors' current 51-game winning streak.
ad14fc04-3b8a-43fa-b406-fc5a169725cb  — Warriors coach Steve Kerr planned to speak with Draymond Green about a now-deleted video posted by the Golden State forward showing his speedometer at 118 mph.

Green said after Golden State's victory Wednesday night over the Clippers he used "poor judgment."

Kerr doesn't expect to have further issues with his emotional player, whose face isn't shown in the driver's seat of the speeding vehicle.

"He said he used poor judgment, which obviously is the case," Kerr said Thursday. "I'm very confident he won't do it again. I'm glad that he's fine and nobody got hurt or anything, but the main thing is he came out and apologized, so we move on."

Green is Golden State's third-leading scorer behind Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson at 13.7 points per game.

His video was shown on TMZ.com.

"Obviously, poor judgment," Green said Wednesday night. "But I'm not here to take any attention away from this team. But, like I said, poor judgment."

Green already apologized to his teammates, coaches and the organization for an emotional outburst late last month during halftime of the Warriors' 121-118 overtime victory at Oklahoma City.

"We hold all of our players and staff members to a high standard that sends a positive message and example to our fans and the community in general," the Warriors said.

The Warriors had a team picture Thursday but otherwise didn't hold a formal practice, though the players were at the facility working. Golden State (64-7) remains one game ahead of the 1995-96 Bulls' pace in their record 72-win season.

The defending champions take their 51-game home winning streak at Oracle Arena, including 33 consecutive victories this season, into Friday's game with Dallas.
c085d908-e55d-4793-a59b-73de52a19df0  In the NBA, a playoff series starts when a road team wins on the opponents court. If that logic is applied to the regular season, the Golden State Warriors-San Antonio Spurs series has yet to begin.

For the first time in NBA history, two teams have recorded 60 wins through the first 71 games of a season. The Warriors (64-7) and Spurs (60-11) have been wildly successful using contrasting styles. San Antonio boasts size, strength, discipline, coaching and reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. Conversely, the Warriors feature speed, focus, joy, selflessness and the reigning Kia MVP Stephen Curry.

Warriors-Spurs: Clash of the Titans This is what we've been waiting for. The Golden State Warriors visit the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday in this highly anticipated contest.

With 11 games remaining in the season, many questions remain. Who has the advantage? Who needs home court more? Which team can impose its will throughout a seven-game series? Ultimately, who will represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals?

For Turner Sports analyst Brent Barry, this has been an incredible season to watch both as a fan and former player. The son of Hall of Fame forward Rick Barry, Brent was essentially born into "Dub Nation." Brent was a 3-year old when his dad led the Warriors to a title during the 1974-75 season. As a player, he won two NBA titles (2005 and '07) with the Spurs. To say he watches both teams closely would be an understatement, and, like most NBA fans, he's fascinated with the results.

"San Antonio is having the best year ever with Tim [Duncan] and [Gregg] Popovich as the head of the team," Barry said. "With regards to the Warriors, I think the fascinating part is maybe how much better they are given what they did last year."

All-Access: 2015 NBA Finals An all-access journey through the 2015 NBA Finals as the Golden State Warriors won their first championship in four decades, by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4-2

Last season, the Warriors won 67 games en route to their first title in 40 seasons. Many questioned their success, attributing much of it to good health and getting hot at the right time. Golden State responded with a 24-0 start and rumblings of a 70-win season began. Not far behind was a retooled Spurs roster that quietly won 19 of its first 24 games. The biggest reason for both teams success has been their flawless home records. A combined 69-0 at home, its safe to say both teams prefer to rest in their own beds before a potential Game 7 matchup. However, one team's preference may be out of necessity.

"I still think the Warriors need it [home court]," Barry said. "I've listened to 100 NBA coaches that have talked about these instances where their monumental seasons have always come down to Game 7s. There's the classic cliche line that anything can happen in a Game 7. Well, if anything can happen, I'd rather it happen in my home where I know where the security buttons are."

Cookin' At Home Spurs Warriors RECORD 36-0 33-0 PPG 105.9 115.9 PPG DIFF. +15.4 +15.6 Allow 100+ 6 20

Both teams have been dominant no matter where the game has been played. However, the Warriors have become synonymous with offense and the Spurs defense. Most teams have an identity that favors one of the two, but for these teams in particular, they've become the poster child of their preferred style of play. The Warriors rely heavily on the 3-pointer. In fact, the backcourt duo of Curry and Klay Thompson have 580 3s made whereas the Spurs have a total of 507 as a team. Surprisingly, Golden State gets a ton of wide open shots.

"The Warriors are not a pick-and-roll team," Barry said. "They are an off-ball movement, back-screening, cutting-away-from-the-ball-action team. Their stars play selflessly without the basketball giving up their bodies. It's something with teams that's very hard to react when you're being drawn in by open players near the basket that end up costing you opportunities to play the right kind of defense against great shooting."

GameTime: Same Spurs David Aldridge and Stu Jackson analyze how San Antonio continues to win by adapting to LaMarcus Aldridge's skill sets.

According to NBA.com/Stats, the Warriors are ranked 30th in pick-and-roll offense, something they use in a game 10.5 percent of the time. Furthermore, they're ranked 23rd in isolation plays (6.2). It should come as no surprise that they lead the league in off-screen plays, generating 11.6 percent of their offense with this style of play. This season, Golden State is the only team to register double-figure frequency of off-screens.

Defensively, the Spurs have been a juggernaut for some time. They've finished with a top-three defensive rating in each of the last four seasons. This season, they've held teams to 90 points or less 32 times, winning 31. Needless to say they've seen every offensive concept possible. Besides great principles, their experience and discipline is what keeps them afloat.

"There's not a lot of things this team hasn't seen," Barry said. "You add their experience with their knowledge along with the guys in their position who are defending or their younger guys in key positions. Other than Tony [Parker] at the point, Danny Green is still a long two-guard, a very good disciplined defensive prowess. Also, you're talking about the best defensive player possibly we've seen on the wing since Scottie Pippen in Kawhi Leonard."

Spurs Defensive Rankings

Def. Rating: 1

PPG: 1

FG%: 1

3PT%: 2

Along with being perfect at home, flawless on offense and defense respectively, both teams are undefeated following a loss this season. Historic alert! No team in NBA history has finished a season without consecutive losses. The numbers prove the Warriors and Spurs are having seasons for the ages. Unfortunately, only one can reach the NBA Finals. In a potential Western Conference finals matchup, who gets the edge?

"I still think the Warriors, because of how much exertion there is to shut down what they can do," Barry said. "Home court and it being the third round of the playoffs, with that much intensity on the defensive end. How much does that cost you with your legs? How much does that cost you with your shooting ability to score the ball? How much can you keep up the pace if the Warriors keep coming at you in waves? That's going to be the most interesting part if and when they play each other."

Its possible that both teams will finish 41-0 at home, becoming the second and third team in NBA history to secure 70 or more wins. Many questions remain to be answered but one things for sure if these two meet in late May to determine the Western Conference Champ, the winner will be the fans.
dad28da1-f64d-44c9-a0d0-8915ec3cf887  With Yahoo! Fantasy playoffs in full swing, here are four waiver-wire players who look ready to contribute this weekend:

Toney Douglas, New Orleans (24 percent owned)

The veteran point guard continues to rack up stats for the Pelicans with Norris Cole (back) sidelined. Over his last three games, Douglas is averaging 13.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 33.1 minutes of action. His field goal percentage (34.2 percent) is troublesome. But his combination of points, assists and rebounds is tough to find on the waiver wire so he is definitely worth a look if you're already losing the field goal percentage category. The Pelicans matchup with the Pacers on Thursday and the Raptors on Saturday.

Jon Leuer, Phoenix (17 percent owned)

The versatile big man has tallied two straight double-doubles since Tyson Chandler (back) went down with injury during Monday's game against Memphis. Over this two-game span, Leuer is averaging 17.5 points on 50.0 percent shooting, 13.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 36.6 minutes. He obviously won't stay at this dominant level for the rest of the season. But you should ride the wave for as long as Chandler is sidelined, which could be indefinitely as the Suns have little to play for over the last couple weeks. Phoenix matches up with Sacramento on Friday and Boston on Saturday.

Salah Mejri, Dallas (14 percent owned)

The Mavericks center has exploded onto the scene in Dallas over his last two games with averages of 13.5 points on 55.6 percent shooting, 13.0 rebounds, 3.5 blocks and 1.0 steals in 31.2 minutes. He should continue to see major minutes for as long as he plays at this high level, so scoop him up quick for his combination of points, rebounds and blocks. The Mavericks matchup with the Warriors on Friday and the Kings on Sunday.

Tim Hardaway Jr., Atlanta (9 percent owned)

The third-year guard has quietly carved out a solid role for himself in Atlanta. Over his last three games, Hardaway is averaging 16.7 points on 60.0 percent shooting, 3.7 3-pointers, 2.7 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 23.7 minutes. He is seventh in the league in 3-pointers over this span and should continue to receive plenty of minutes with the Hawks. Give him a look if you need to pad your 3-point category this weekend. The Hawks matchup with the Bucks on Friday and the Pistons on Saturday.

Stat Line Of The Week

Nightly Notable: Russell Westbrook Russell Westbrook notches his third consecutive triple-double scoring 21 points with 15 assists and 12 rebounds to charge the Thunder over the Rockets.

d241ed52-6dfe-46e6-a6ca-7dd226c3994f  — San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard left the Spurs' game against the Miami Heat midway through the third quarter Wednesday night after suffering a bruised right quadriceps.

Leonard matched a career high with 32 points on 12-for-21 shooting before leaving with 6:01 remaining in the third quarter.

Leonard left after making a free throw to complete a three-point play after being fouled on a driving layup by Justise Winslow. The All-Star forward went to the locker room following the free throw, followed closely by Spurs trainer Will Sevening.

San Antonio was leading Miami by as many as 29 points in its bid for a 36th straight home victory to open the season, which would put the Spurs a game shy of the record set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96.
d7d5370b-0122-474b-8c05-adc243930dc4  — Clippers coach Doc Rivers expects Blake Griffin to return before the regular season ends from a broken hand the star forward suffered by punching an assistant equipment manager.

Griffin isn't practicing yet with Los Angeles but he is running and shooting again, and "he's doing great. He looks pretty good, so that's why I feel confident," Rivers says.

Griffin was suspended for four games by Los Angeles and also docked five games' pay of $859,442 for the Jan. 23 altercation at a Toronto restaurant.

Rivers said before his team's game at Golden State, "I think he will (return) but I don't think any of us know anything in that regard. I think he will be."
b4e6a71f-92f9-49ca-ac4a-89d2f1db29e1  — NBA Digital has added new statistics to the NBA app, including some that track player defensive performance.

The upgrades unveiled Wednesday include a tab for season totals in categories such as points, rebounds and assists, so users can switch between that and per-game averages.

New to the defensive impact page within the player tracking section is field goals made and field goal percentage while defending at the rim, and blocks per game in those situations.

The NBA app has 35 million downloads, with visits up 17 percent this season.
accede29-0e8b-4362-a9ff-67b3480a4651  — Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg was reunited with his former Iowa State players and coaching staff on Wednesday.

Less than a year after leaving the Cyclones to accept the Bulls' job, Hoiberg greeted the team as it prepared for its Sweet Sixteen matchup against No. 1 seed Virginia at the United Center on Friday night.

Hoiberg was 115-56 in five seasons as coach of the Cyclones and guided them to four NCAA Tournament appearances, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2014.

The Cyclones met with Hoiberg on Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, where Hoiberg addressed the team hours before the Bulls' matchup against the New York Knicks.

Hoiberg will miss Iowa State's game on Friday while the Bulls are on a two-game road trip, but he expects to be at the game on Sunday if the Cyclones advance.

"It's really cool. I told them to take of business because we will be on the road. I'll be in a bar in Orlando watching somewhere. I already have a ticket for Sunday so I'm ready to watch them cut down those nets and go to the Final Four," Hoiberg said.

Hoiberg has a special connection with Iowa State since he grew up in Ames and starred for the Cyclones from 1991-95. He garnered the nickname "The Mayor."

"The biggest thing is not only as a former coach and the relationship with those guys and as alumni of the university is just how proud I am with those group of guys. I told them to step back and enjoy it. That's one thing I regret. I did not do that," Hoiberg said.

Iowa State players and coaching staff were expected to be in attendance to watch the Bulls play Wednesday.

"Obviously it is a group of guys that are really special. I have a big place in my heart for them. I'm certainly going to cheer them on hard this weekend," said Hoiberg.
5d1ee0df-2abf-483f-9eb9-04507712006e  — Sacramento Kings star center DeMarcus Cousins was scratched from the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night with a bruised right knee.

Cousins was listed as questionable for the game going in, but declared out by coach George Karl earlier in the day. Cousins has cemented himself as one of the best big men in the NBA, averaging 27.1 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists to carry the Kings.

Veteran backup Kosta Koufos was inserted into the starting lineup in place of Cousins, who missed a chance to play against fellow Kentucky Wildcat Karl-Anthony Towns.

Rajon Rondo was able to play while dealing with several ailments and Willie Cauley-Stein (flu) was active for the game.
243f5966-9950-41d4-a1ae-9137079680c3  — Detroit guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is sitting out the Pistons' game Wednesday against Orlando because of an illness.

Backup guard Reggie Bullock is also out with an illness. The Pistons started rookie Darrun Hilliard, a second-round draft pick.

Caldwell-Pope is averaging 14.7 points and a team-high 36.8 minutes. The Pistons are playing the fifth game of a nine-game homestand that could go a long way toward determining whether they make the playoffs for the first time since 2009.

Orlando is without center Nikola Vucevic, who has been out with a strained right groin.
05a0dcb7-9182-4aaf-8e92-e3d237d439c0  — Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry is not starting and not expected to play against the Celtics as he rests a sore right elbow.

The Raptors can clinch a playoff spot with a victory Wednesday or loss by either Chicago or Detroit

Lowry sustained the injury in Toronto's win over Orlando on Sunday. He played 40 minutes in that game, scoring 18 points.

Raptors coach Dwane Casey said before the game that he won't hesitate to rest players down the stretch to keep them fresh for the playoffs, even though Toronto is right behind Cleveland for the No. 1 seed in the East.
91838c98-f4fc-4017-a2ca-82675ebd4794  — A federal judge has dismissed a $600 million antitrust lawsuit filed by former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling against the NBA and his wife Shelly Sterling.

In the Tuesday order, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin said he was "skeptical Sterling suffered any injury at all, let alone an antitrust injury" by the sale of the team for $2 billion to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and called other parts of the lawsuit implausible.

Donald Sterling, 81, had claimed in the lawsuit that he could have gotten more than that for the team but the circumstances of the sale "markedly reduced" the price.

Shelly Sterling's attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement that the dismissal "puts a merciful end to his quixotic litigation campaign over the sale for the record-shattering price of $2 billion."

O'Donnell added that, "Ironically, Donald, in defeat, is the beneficiary of $2 billion, secured by Shelley in her courageous battle in doing the right thing to protect her family and ensure that her beloved team would be sold to a conscientious owner who would take the team to the next level of excellence."

Donald Sterling's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NBA declined to comment.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life in 2014 and fined him $2.5 million over recorded racist remarks that he made to a friend.

The dismissed lawsuit had also named Silver, his predecessor as commissioner David Stern, and two doctors who examined Donald Sterling and determined that he had symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, leading his wife to remove him from a family trust that owned the Clippers at the time.

Earlier this month, Sterling and long-estranged wife Shelly decided to remain in their marriage of 60 years, backing out of a divorce he had filed for in August.
70618601-f4b6-4047-b8ca-467eda74e609  — Carmelo Anthony returned to the New York Knicks' starting lineup Wednesday night against the Chicago Bulls after missing a loss Sunday night against Sacramento because of a migraine headache.

The star forward started feeling symptoms in a loss to Washington on Saturday. He is averaging 21.8 points and 8.0 rebounds this season.

The Knicks are 0-8 without Anthony this season.
a96c5390-2829-472e-9b1e-bac75bc7e674  — The NBA announced today that Los Angeles has been selected to host NBA All-Star 2018. The 67th annual game will take place at Staples Center, home of the L.A. Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers, on Sunday, Feb. 18. This will mark the record sixth NBA All-Star in Los Angeles, which hosted in 2011, 2004, 1983, 1972 and 1963, and the third All-Star at Staples Center (2011 and 2004).

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made the announcement today during a press conference at Staples Center, where he was joined by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, AEG President and CEO Dan Beckerman and Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission President Kathy Schloessman.

"Los Angeles is known for first-class hospitality and entertainment, making it the perfect host for NBA All-Star," said Silver. "The city is home to some of the most passionate basketball fans in addition to extraordinary facilities, including Staples Center and L.A. Live. We thank Mayor Garcetti, Clippers Owner Steve Ballmer, Lakers President and Co-Owner Jeanie Buss and AEG President and CEO Dan Beckerman for their support in bringing All-Star back to L.A."

"We are proud that the NBA has selected Staples Center, L.A. Live and the L.A. Convention Center to host NBA All-Star for the third time in just 14 years," said Beckerman. "All-Star in Los Angeles will bring worldwide attention, thousands of fans and over $100 million of economic activity to our City. We believe that L.A. Live, with its variety of venues, hotels and other hospitality options, creates a true headquarters district that will be the ideal showcase for NBA All-Star 2018. Finally, on behalf of AEG, we thank our partners at the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission for your commitment to bring back this incredible event and thank Commissioner Silver and the NBA for your faith in our great City."

"Since becoming part of L.A. through my ownership of the Clippers, I've witnessed firsthand the passion this city has for basketball and celebrating world-class talent, and I can't wait to see what's in store for both players and fans during NBA All-Star 2018," said Ballmer. "I'm also thrilled that Mayor Garcetti and the city of Los Angeles will be able to show off their vision and the incredible evolution of downtown L.A."

2018 All-Star Game Los Angeles: Media Q&A NBA Commissioner Adam silver takes questions from the media following the Los Angeles 2018 All-Star announcement.

"All-Star is a premiere event, so it's fitting that it'll be hosted by Los Angeles, the premiere sports city in America, and by Staples Center, one of the premiere arenas in the world," said Los Angeles Lakers President and Co-Owner Jeanie Buss. "2004 and 2011 proved what a great combination this is, and 2018 will prove it again."

NBA All-Star on-court events will tip off on Friday, Feb. 16, at Staples Center with the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge, where the league's top rookies and second-year players take the court. On Feb. 17, State Farm All-Star Saturday Night will feature current NBA players showcasing their skills in exciting basketball competitions that include the Taco Bell Skills Challenge, where participants compete head-to-head in a series of passing, shooting and agility drills; the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest; and Verizon Slam Dunk. The weekend concludes on Sunday with the NBA All-Star Game.

"Los Angeles is one of the world's great basketball cities -- a place where players become legends and great NBA moments last forever," said Mayor Garcetti. "Now we will make history again, in 2018, by hosting our sixth NBA All-Star Game, something no other city has done. I look forward to working with the NBA and our local partners on this amazing event at Staples Center, which will bring thousands of visitors to Los Angeles, and generate more than $100 million of economic activity."

In partnership with AEG, the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission (LASEC) and the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board (LATCB), the NBA will host several events for fans of all ages at venues throughout the city, including the Los Angeles Convention Center and L.A. Live. These events, including NBA All-Star Practice, the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game presented by Mountain Dew and the NBA Development League All-Star Game presented by Kumho Tire, will feature interactive programming bringing fans closer to NBA and WNBA players and legends.

"It is exciting and humbling for us to be hosting NBA All-Star again for the third time in 14 years," said Schloessman. "Events like the NBA All-Star fill our hotels, employ Angelenos and bring direct spending to our restaurants, shops, attractions, and an economic windfall to our city. Having the unique assets and venues of L.A. Live continues to play an important role in bringing these great high-profile events to our City."

During NBA All-Star 2018, the NBA will continue to celebrate its tradition and commitment to social responsibility with a full schedule of NBA Cares events. Through partnerships with schools, government and local nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, the league will reach thousands of children and families and provide important resources to community-based programs.

NBA All-Star Game 2018 will be televised in prime time on TNT for the 16th consecutive year, marking Turner Sports' 33rd year of NBA All-Star coverage. The game will be broadcast worldwide in more than 200 countries and territories and in more than 40 languages.

NBA All-Star 2016 in Toronto featured the highest-scoring All-Star Game in NBA history; an epic Verizon Slam Dunk won by reigning champion Zach LaVine of the Minnesota Timberwolves; and an exhilarating Foot Locker Three-Point Contest won by the Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson, who narrowly beat teammate and 2014-15 Kia NBA MVP Stephen Curry. NBA All-Star 2017 will take place in Charlotte, N.C.

NBA ALL-STAR HISTORY IN LOS ANGELES

Staples Center last played host to NBA All-Star in 2011, when dazzling performances by hometown favorites Kobe Bryant of the Lakers and Blake Griffin of the Clippers highlighted the weekend. Bryant was named Kia NBA All-Star MVP for a record-tying fourth time after scoring 37 points as the West overcame LeBron James' triple-double to defeat the East 148-143. Griffin played in the game as a rookie, an appearance that followed his memorable victory in Verizon Slam Dunk and his role in helping the Rookies beat the Sophomores 148-140 in the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge.

NBA All-Star's return to Los Angeles in 2018 will mark the 55-year anniversary of the first midseason classic in the city. In 1963, Bill Russell finished with 19 points and 24 rebounds to lead the East past the West 115-108 at Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Russell took home the MVP award, an honor also bestowed on the Lakers' Jerry West (1972), the Philadelphia 76ers' Julius Erving (1983) and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal (2004) in subsequent All-Star Games in Los Angeles.
e0740298-107d-4c66-acea-7643a9e932b3  — A Los Angeles Lakers spokesman said there are "different interpretations" about what happened during an interaction between players Nick Young and Jordan Clarkson and a woman who accused them of harassing her.

Coach Byron Scott also said he spoke with the players about Sunday night's incident in Hollywood with Alexis Jones, an activist and public speaker against sexual harassment and domestic violence. The Lakers haven't indicated any intention of taking disciplinary action against Young or Clarkson.

"The situation is just a miscommunication on both sides," Clarkson said after leading the Lakers with 22 points in a 107-100 victory over Memphis on Tuesday night. "We don't want to go into further detail on who's right and who's wrong in that situation, but at the end of the day, it was a miscommunication."

Jones claims that at least one of the two players gestured obscenely at her and her mother while the parties' cars were stopped at an intersection. After Jones posted the players' photos on Instagram with a message describing "disgustingly vulgar gestures" made by some of the four men in the car, commenters informed her that the men were Young and Clarkson.

Team spokesman John Black said the Lakers have spoken to Jones, Young and Clarkson about what happened.

"Our conclusion is that there are different interpretations of what happened," Black said. "We support Nick and Jordan and believe what they told us about the incidents and their actions. We also are supportive of Alexis and her feelings about what happened, about women's rights, and of the fine work Alexis is doing with her organization."

Clarkson and Young, who didn't play against the Grizzlies, both spoke briefly before boarding a team flight to Phoenix. While neither player offered any details or their interpretation of the incident, Young said its 48-hour escalation was "a bold statement."

"You've just got to watch your surroundings," he said. "We live in a world where social media plays a big part in what you do, so you've just got to be careful about your surroundings and where you're at."

Black said the Lakers attempted to arrange a meeting among Jones, Young and Clarkson to talk about what happened, but Jones' schedule didn't permit it. He said the Lakers are interested in inviting Jones to address the team about issues of respect.

"I talked to those guys (Monday) about that incident," Scott said Tuesday night before the game. "My conversation with them is always private, and we're just going to leave it at that."

Clarkson is the Lakers' starting shooting guard, ranking second on the team with 15.5 points per game. He has emerged as a dependable NBA regular in two seasons since the club drafted him in the second round out of Missouri.

Young is a Los Angeles native and a flamboyant backup guard for the Lakers, although the USC product nicknamed "Swaggy P." has made increasingly meager scoring contributions this season. He is engaged to Australian rapper Iggy Azalea.

The Lakers are the Western Conference's worst team at 15-55 even after beating Memphis to snap a four-game skid.

LAKERS' COMPLETE STATEMENT:

"We've looked into the situation and spoken to Alexis Jones as well as to Nick Young and Jordan Clarkson. Based on these conversations, our conclusion is that there are different interpretations of what happened. We support Nick and Jordan and believe what they told us about the incidents and their actions. We also are supportive of Alexis and her feelings about what happened, about women's rights, and of the fine work Alexis is doing with her organization. I had several conversations with Alexis and her publicist, and tried to arrange a meeting between her, Nick and Jordan. Unfortunately, Alexis's schedule didn't allow for this to happen yesterday. We will also continue to stay in touch with her about the possibility of addressing our team about the important issues with which she's involved."


05fe8288-7de9-4f8e-9626-20511972adfd  — Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry says forward Ryan Anderson, who has been New Orleans' second-leading scorer this season, has been ruled out of playing in Tuesday night's game against the Miami Heat because of groin strains in both legs.

Known for his ability to spread defenses with his 3-point shooting, the 6-foot-10 Anderson has averaged 17 points per game this season. Only forward Anthony Davis, who is out the rest of the season, has averaged more points for the Pelicans.

This marks the second straight game Anderson is missing, having also sat out last Sunday's victory over the Los Angeles Clippers

Gentry says team doctors are still trying to determine if it makes more sense to simply sit Anderson out for the final 13 games of the regular season.
1d973099-3f86-4a09-a360-fcebd46890f3  — NBA Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo was at the Brussels airport during a deadly terrorist attack early Tuesday.

Mutombo posted two messages on his Facebook page to let everyone know he was not injured. The Atlanta Hawks confirmed that he was in Belgium when the terrorists struck at both the airport and on a subway, killing at least 31 people and wounding scores.

Mutombo posted one photo showing people walking around outside the airport, accompanied by the message, "God is good. I am in Brussels Airport with this craziness. I am fine." He followed with a selfie and another message, "Thank you everyone. I am safe here. God is good."

The 49-year-old Mutombo is a native of the Congo who now lives in Atlanta. The eight-time All-Star retired in 2009.
34a95725-80b7-4780-9fa6-e88b64c20521  — LeBron's locked in already. Now he's got to get the Cavs to, ahem, follow him.

Following a personal rite of spring he began several years ago, LeBron James has begun preparing for the upcoming NBA playoffs by limiting his access to social media in order to avoid outside distractions as he and the Cavaliers make another run at an NBA title.

James, who has coined his social media blackout "Zero Dark 23," took some early steps toward sharpening his focus by unfollowing the Cavaliers' account - and those of some media members - on Twitter. That click, which coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the online social networking giant's launch, caused a seismic wave on the Internet at nearly the same time James and the Cavs were clinching their second straight Central Division title.

James recorded his 41st career triple-double in Cleveland's 124-91 victory over Denver, and then fueled more speculation afterward by refusing to comment on the reason he unfollowed (at)cavs.

And while the four-time league MVP didn't offer any specifics Wednesday, he did acknowledge that he's shifted into playoff mode with several weeks still left in the season.

"I have, a little bit sooner than normal," he said following practice. "But you know I understand that it's right around the corner and I want to start mentally preparing myself for the distance. So mentally I'm just being a little more sharper minded as of late, just gearing toward it."

James' social media habits have come under greater scrutiny during his second season back in Cleveland after he posted several mysterious messages, some of which seemed aimed at teammates. His Twitter cleansing also came on the same day he declined to speak to reporters following the team's morning shootaround, and James was also more subdued before the game.

James usually plays music while he dresses at his corner locker, barking out lyrics along with some of his hip-hop favorites. He's the Cavs' in-house DJ.

But before Monday's game, James kept his headphones on, prompting teammate Channing Frye to ask him why he was "hogging" the tunes.

In his 13th season, James, who has been to the Finals in each of the past five years, knows how to motivate himself and his teammates. And although the Cavs have the best record in the Eastern Conference, they've been inconsistent.

Cleveland was beaten at Utah last week and blown out Saturday night in Miami.

James, though, feels the team is beginning to hit its stride at the perfect time.

"At the end of the day, we're 9-3 in our last 12, so, I mean, we're playing some good ball," he said. "We just didn't play how we want to play in the Utah game and in Miami, but we're playing some good ball."

James' dream is to bring Cleveland its first pro sports championship since 1964. He and the Cavs took the first step by winning their division, the eighth straight for James, who sandwiched two straight around the four he won with Miami.

"I wish it was like baseball and we pop some champagne or some beers or something in the locker room after we win," he joked. "But to be a part of eight straight, it's an honor. It's pretty cool. Obviously I know what my main goal is, my ultimate goal, but along the journey you have things like that, accomplishments like that, it's pretty cool. It's not given every year."
e4b5cb14-2902-4169-af5d-b5e13fc35ed6  — Mavericks forward Chandler Parsons is having surgery on his right knee again but might not be finished for the season.

A person with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday that Parsons was having arthroscopic surgery for a meniscus tear in his right knee but could return.

The team said Parsons will not make the upcoming four-game road trip because of the right knee injury, and coach Rick Carlisle declined to discuss the specifics. The person spoke of Parsons' injury on the condition of anonymity because details weren't released.

Parsons left in the third quarter of Friday's loss to Golden State with what the team said was right hamstring soreness. He missed Sunday's win over Portland.

The Mavericks play the Trail Blazers again Wednesday night before going to Golden State, Sacramento and Denver.

The injury isn't considered as serious as the one that knocked Parsons out of the first round of the playoffs last season and required surgery and a long rehabilitation that carried over into training camp and limited his playing time early this season.

Parsons could resume basketball activities within six weeks, which means he could be available when the playoffs start in mid-April. There are roughly three weeks left in the regular season.

The timing of the injury isn't good for the Mavericks, who lose a starter while in a four-way battle for the final three playoff spots in the Western Conference. Dallas (35-35) is tied for seventh with Houston but can overtake Portland for sixth with a win at the Blazers. Utah (34-36) is also in the mix.

The previous knee injury came late last regular season, and Parsons tried to return for the playoffs. He played the opener against Houston but sat the rest of that five-game loss to Houston, his former team.

The 27-year-old Parsons came back from surgery sooner than expected, missing only the first two games before playing on a minutes restriction while skipping the second night of most back-to-backs.

By December, he was playing close to 30 minutes and occasionally in back-to-back games. One of his best games came in January, when he had 25 points and eight rebounds in 41 minutes in a 110-107 overtime loss to Cleveland and LeBron James.

Parsons is averaging 13.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 30 minutes over 61 games, including 51 starts.
ba2096f4-39f8-452a-8988-6b3197ed4c5e  — Philadelphia 76ers center Jahlil Okafor underwent a successful arthroscopic procedure today to address a slight tear of the meniscus in his right knee.

The minor procedure was performed by Dr. James Andrews of the Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine and Sixers Head Physician and Orthopedic Surgeon of the Rothman Institute at Jefferson Dr. Christopher Dodson.

Okafor will begin his rehabilitation program tomorrow under the guidance of Sixers Director Of Performance Research & Development Dr. David T. Martin.
34d8a56d-53ab-4c41-8fa5-abb1476c4dfe  — Indiana Pacers point guard Ty Lawson will serve a year on probation in a Denver drunken driving case after a judge on Tuesday rejected arguments that he needed to serve time in jail to learn a lesson.

The former Denver Nugget was arrested twice on drunken driving charges last year - first in Denver in January and then in Los Angeles in July. He also has two previous DUI arrests that don't count as prior offenses - one in North Carolina in 2008 for underage drinking and driving when he was 20 and another in 2011 in Missouri. Underage cases don't count as prior offenses for an adult and Lawson, now 28, avoided a conviction in the other under a deal that required him to stay out of more trouble.

Prosecutor Chris Curtis asked for Lawson to spend at least a month in jail because he said his behavior has not changed and he has not suffered any consequences for it.

"Mr. Lawson thinks this is no big deal," Curtis said, as Lawson stood a few feet away in the courtroom dressed in a black polo shirt and pants next to his lawyer.

While Curtis said anything but jail time would send the message that Lawson was getting special treatment, Lawson's lawyer, Harvey Steinberg, said prosecutors were treating Lawson more harshly because of his celebrity. He said no one else usually gets put behind bars for a first drunken driving conviction.

Judge Olympia Fay agreed but warned Lawson that he was on a "bad path" and needed to change before he or someone else got hurt.

"You don't want that on your heart. No one does," she said.

Lawson, who declined to comment in court and after the hearing, completed a court-ordered 30-day residential treatment program at Cliffside Malibu, a celebrity rehabilitation center in California before being sentenced.

Denver traded Lawson to the Houston Rockets last summer but he lost his starting job 11 games into the season. The Rockets bought out his contract and the Indiana Pacers decided to take a chance on Lawson earlier this month.

Lawson, who has been hampered by a sprained foot, made his second appearance with the team Monday night against the Philadelphia 76ers.
ef8792ad-08ad-45b3-aa2b-c2c6deee7f43  — Chicago Bulls center Pau Gasol will return against the Sacramento Kings on Monday night after missing the previous four games with right knee swelling.

Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg says Gasol is "chomping at the bit to get back on the floor. Obviously, we flow better with him out there."

Gasol, who is averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds, hasn't played since March 11 against Miami. After resting for about a week, he tested the knee in workouts on Saturday and Sunday.

Hoiberg says the plan was "to control his minutes and see how he responds to it. He's handled two straight days of activity very well."
4ad5a6cf-0699-4522-845b-f603c0804416  — Cavaliers starting forward Kevin Love will sit out against Denver with an unspecified illness.

Love has missed four games this season for the Cavs, who clinch the Central Division title with a win over the Nuggets on Monday night.

Love did not participate in the team's morning shootaround and the Cavs announced that he was not playing about an hour before tip-off. Channing Frye will start for Love, who is averaging 15.6 points and 9.9 rebounds in his second season with Cleveland.

He was recently rested for a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, part of coach Tyronn Lue's plan to keep his starters fresh for the playoffs.

Love played only 16 minutes in Saturday's lopsided loss at Miami. The previous night he scored 14 points in 23 minutes - but was kept on the bench for the fourth quarter in a win over Orlando.
fd6a828d-d0b1-4f57-b7da-f89b3ff573e1  — Dwight Howard is surprised and disappointed that he's being labeled a cheater.

The NBA is reviewing the Rockets center's use of a sticky substance on his hands during Houston's loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. Atlanta's Paul Millsap complained about the ball while shooting free throws with 3:36 remaining in the first quarter. Howard had made a layup before Millsap's free throws.

Howard said Monday that he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.

"I just think that it's getting overblown, like I'm doing something crazy," he said. "But again, I've never been a cheater, never been the type of player that has to do something illegal to win. It's upsetting, but I can't control it now."

After the incident, referees gave warnings to each bench and then approached the scorer's table, where they were directed to a can covered with white tape. The can was removed, and one of the officials told the scorer to alert him if it was seen again.

Howard noted that many players use sprays and powders on their hands during games.

"I've been using the spray for the last five years," he said. "I never hid the spray. I never did anything to try to hide what I was doing. It was just something to make my hands dry."

There was no penalty issued during the game. Rockets coach J.B. Bickerstaff said the league interviewed him Sunday night, but he hasn't been notified of any disciplinary action. The Rockets play the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.

Bickerstaff was surprised that anyone asked about the can, and by reports that the team tried to hide it from the officials.

"Every time Dwight goes into the game, it's the same routine," he said. "It was no cover-up on my part."

Bickerstaff said Howard has done nothing wrong.

"He's never run to the back in the locker room to try to trick anyone," he said. "It was never brought to our attention. No one's ever said anything to us about it. If you go back, you can watch every single one of our games for the past three years, it's (the can) there. So we were obviously surprised by the attention it has drawn."
210158b3-39b9-403f-8d18-0f878cb32150  — The Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry and the Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant today were named NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for games played Monday, March 14 through Sunday, March 20.

Lowry guided the Raptors to a 4-1 week, averaging 27.2 points (fourth in the Eastern Conference and the NBA), 6.8 assists (eighth in the conference), 6.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals (seventh in the conference). He was the only player in the East to average at least 25.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists. Lowry scored 30 or more points twice, including a 32-point performance to go with five assists, four rebounds and two steals in a 105-91 victory over the Boston Celtics on March 18.

Durant led the Thunder to a 4-0 week behind averages of 26.8 points (tied for first in the Western Conference), 9.5 rebounds and 7.5 assists. He scored 20 or more points in all four contests, including a 33-point performance in Oklahoma City's 115-111 road win over the Indiana Pacers on March 19. Durant closed the week with back-to-back double-doubles against the Philadelphia 76ers (26 points and 13 rebounds) on March 18 and the Indiana Pacers (33 points and 13 rebounds) on March 19.

6c9a33e8-ccb2-406c-be8d-4f69191dff15  — The Memphis Grizzlies have signed veteran guard Jordan Farmar to a 10-day contract.

Farmar has played 490 games and has made 30 starts across eight NBA seasons. He holds career averages of 7.7 points, 2.9 assists, 1.9 rebounds and 19.4 minutes per game.

The 29-year-old also has played 69 playoff games, all with the Los Angeles Lakers. He played in three consecutive NBA Finals from 2008-10.

Farmar, who is 6-foot-2, played for Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv for the first part of the 2015-16 season. He also has played in Turkey.

The Lakers selected Farmar out of UCLA with the 26th overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft.
0b524c42-78e1-459e-be7b-bb92be284d95  — LSU freshman forward Ben Simmons, who led the Tigers in scoring, rebounds and assists this season, has decided to turn pro and relinquish his final three seasons of college eligibility.

"We knew that there was a great possibility that Ben would only be at LSU for one season," Jones said Monday. "And if you are going to have a guy to do that, Ben was the perfect one because of how much of a team player he is. We are happy about the development that transpired during his time here and think he will continue to make great strides as he transitions into the NBA.

Simmons, who initially announced his decision in an interview with ESPN, said he will soon hire an agent and enter the NBA draft, for which Simmons has been widely projected as a top overall pick.

Simmons, who grew up in Australia before moving to Florida for three years of high school at Montverde Academy, averaged 19.2 points, 11.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists this season with LSU.

"Ben was a tremendous teammate and a great competitor," Jones said. "He brought a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm to our team and did an outstanding job of making those around him better. That's something that this team will benefit from as we go forward."

Opposing coaches and NBA scouts alike have gushed over Simmons' all-court game, vision and instincts, as well as ball-handling and passing ability seen as exceptional for a player with his 6-foot-10 height. Yet he wasn't immune to criticism. He never demonstrated he could make jump shots consistently, rarely shooting from outside and going only 1 of 3 from 3-point range all season. He also exhibited an inclination to pass, rather than create his own shot, in the late stages of close games.

His presence raised LSU's national exposure on television and filled seats in the stands; LSU averaged crowds of 11,400 at home and 13,700 on the road. But Simmons was not able to improve his college program's fortunes on court.

After making the NCAA Tournament the season before Simmons arrived, the Tigers finished this season 19-14, missing the tourney after failing to reach 20 victories for the first time in three years. LSU might have had a chance to reach the 20-victory mark in a post-season tournament such as the NIT, but Jones announced pre-emptively that the Tigers would not accept any invitations to post-season tournaments after they'd failed to receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament.

It also remains to be seen whether Simmons will leave LSU in good academic standing. LSU was informed earlier this month that Simmons did not meet the requirements for the Wooden Award, which is presented to the nation's top college player.

The award's published criteria say candidates must be full-time students with consideration "given to scholastic achievement and aspirations." Candidates also must have cumulative grade point averages of 2.0 since enrolling.

Simmons didn't start a Feb. 20 loss at Tennessee for what Jones said then was an academic issue. And while Simmons remains eligible for other national awards, Jones did not say in his end-of-season meeting with reporters last week whether Simmons was still going to class.
e11f626b-a9b2-42d4-8c98-f7b7a9e78167  Spurs vs. Hornets (7 ET, NBA TV)

Inside Access: Warriors - Spurs In a highly anticipated meeting of the two top teams in the NBA, the Spurs evened the series out at one game apiece with the Warriors.

Riding High

The Spurs storm into Charlotte fresh off their biggest win of the season over the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. The Spurs' league-leading defense held the defending champs to a season-low 79 points on 37.8 percent shooting and the reigning Kia MVP, Stephen Curry, to just 14 points on a season-low 1-for-12 from 3-point land. It was a dominating performance that silenced any doubters who believed San Antonio was overmatched by Golden State after their 30-point loss in mid-January. The Spurs face another challenge tonight against the Charlotte Hornets, who are one of the hottest teams in the league since February. Speaking of the Hornets' hot stretch ...

All The Buzz

The Spurs (20-2) and the Warriors (19-3) are the only teams to have a better record than the Hornets (17-5) since January 31. Charlotte has the third best defensive rating and the ninth best offensive rating during this span. Since the beginning of March, the Hornets have the third best offensive rating. They're led by Kemba Walker, who has been unbelievable over this stretch with averages of 25.2 points on 47.6 percent shooting, 6.4 assists and 5.5 rebounds in 36.6 minutes since March 1. The best way for the Spurs to defend the Hornets' attack is to control the 3-point line. Charlotte ranks third in 3-pointers made, fifth in 3-pointers attempted and sixth in 3-point percentage since January 31.

Playoff Implications

The Spurs enter with a comfortable, 11.5-game lead over the Thunder for the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference and trail the Warriors by just 3.0 games for the No. 1 seed. They still have two more matchups against Golden State over the final 13 games of the season, so there's still a chance for them to claim the top spot and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. Charlotte finds itself in a much tighter race as it sits in the No. 6 seed out East. The Hornets trail the Hawks by 1.5 games for the No. 3 seed and lead the No. 9 seed Pistons by just 3.5 games. A win tonight would go a long way for Charlotte as it looks to land in one of the top four seeds to secure home court advantage in the first round.

Grizzlies vs. Suns (10 ET, NBA TV)

Grit And Mend

The Grizzlies have been ravished by injuries over the past few weeks, playing for significant stretches without Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Zach Randolph. Memphis started strong without Gasol, going 9-4 over their first 13 games without the All-NBA center. But the losses of Conley and Randolph proved too much to handle as they suffered a four-game losing streak last week. Fortunately for Memphis, Randolph returned on Saturday against the Clippers and tallied the first triple-double of his career to lead Memphis to victory. The Grizzlies are currently the No. 5 seed in the West and lead the No. 9 seed Jazz by 6.0 games. But this buffer could dissolve quickly as the Grizzlies matchup with the Warriors twice, Spurs twice, Raptors, Mavericks and Clippers over their final 12 games. This tough remaining schedule increases the importance of a win against the struggling Suns tonight.

Randolph's 1st Triple-Double Zach Randolph recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists against the Clippers.

Setting Suns

Phoenix is officially eliminated from playoff contention after a brutal season full of injuries and distractions. Despite their rough play, the Suns have been better of late with a record of 4-4 over their last eight games (including a 109-100 victory over the Grizzlies two weeks ago). Nineteen-year-old rookie Devin Booker has been one of the few bright spots for Phoenix this season as he averages 21.7 points, 5.3 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 38.0 minutes during the month of March. Booker, alongside point guard Brandon Knight, will look to outpace the battered Grizzlies and continue their solid stretch to close out the season.

Lance Makes 'Em Dance

Lance Stephenson has been a necessary boost of offense for the Grizzlies since he was acquired from the Los Angeles Clippers in mid-February. In 15 games with the Grizzlies, Stephenson is averaging 15.0 points on 49.2 percent shooting, 5.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and only 1.6 turnovers in 26.8 minutes. He has two games with more than 20 points during this span, including a 33-point explosion against the Pelicans on March 11. Keep an eye on Stephenson tonight as look to spark the Grizzlies to a key road win in Phoenix.

d374a5e2-e31b-48fd-b952-d6ac7ea5e8ae  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

bd8f6c50-b100-4683-8c90-616a88e8e11e  — Cavaliers starting guard point Kyrie Irving will miss Sunday's game against Charlotte with a sprained right ankle.

Irving injured his ankle late in the first half of Friday night's overtime win in Atlanta. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue does not know how long Irving, who missed the season's first 24 games while recovering from offseason knee surgery, will be sidelined.

Matthew Dellavedova will start in place of Irving, who averages 19.5 points and 4.6 assists.

Irving scored 20 points in the win over the Hawks, but went just 5 of 23 from the field.

The Cavs have a three-game lead over Toronto for the top seed in the Eastern Conference and Lue wants to get some of his starters some rest before the playoffs begin. LeBron James is in the lineup Sunday and Lue said he hasn't decided when he'll sit some key players.
05f0c1ce-56ff-4c29-b79a-341d48893c48  Blazers vs. Warriors (8 ET, NBA TV)

Elite Duos

Two of the top three scoring backcourts in the NBA match up during an exciting Western Conference showdown on NBA TV. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson lead the Warriors' attack with 52.4 points per game while Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum power Portland with an average of 45.8 points. Golden State's Splash Brothers along with Lillard are the top three 3-point shooters in the league, each hitting more than 3.0 3-pointers per game. On Feb. 19, Lillard dominated the Warriors for a career-high 51 points to help Portland deal Golden State one of its eight losses this season. Will Lillard and the Blazers be able to do it again in Oakland tonight to secure a fifth straight win?

Lillard's Career-High Damian Lillard scores a career-high 51 points to lead the Trail Blazers to a dominant 137-105 win over the Warriors.

Starting A New Streak

The Warriors' 54-game regular season home winning streak was snapped by the Celtics on Friday night. Boston was aggressive on defense, holding the Warriors' top four scorers (Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes) to a combined 25-for-59 shooting (42.3 percent). The Warriors will look to bounce back from that performance tonight as they hope to avoid back-to-back losses at home for the first time since January 2014. Golden State is 2-1 against Portland this season, with the winning team scoring at least 128 points in each of the series' three games.

Playoff Implications

The Warriors hold a 4-game lead over the No. 2 seed Spurs with six games remaining, including two against San Antonio. A win tonight would all but lock up the top spot for Golden State. The Trail Blazers sit in the No. 6 seed, 0.5 games behind No. 5 seed Memphis and 2.5 games ahead of No. 7 seed Dallas and No. 8 seed Utah. Portland could jump into the No. 5 seed tonight with a win over Golden State and a Memphis loss against Orlando (6 ET, League Pass). In addition, Portland can clinch its third consecutive playoff berth with a win and losses by Dallas, Utah and Houston tonight. Be sure to keep an eye on NBA.com/PlayoffPicture over the final two weeks of the regular season to see how every game impacts the final standings.

Eyes On 73

The Warriors need to finish 5-1 over their final six games to secure an NBA-record 73 wins. After tonight's game in Oakland, the Warriors play two more at home (against Minnesota and San Antonio) before a quick two-game trip (at Memphis and San Antonio) leads into their final game of the season at home (against Memphis). It's not an easy final six games, which makes tonight's game at home even more important for the champs who have chased 73 wins all season. A win tonight would tie Golden State with the 1971-72 Lakers and 1996-97 Bulls for second most wins all-time.

e80ee72d-fcda-41d5-8861-0bd25cb75b9e  — Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose will miss tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons with an elbow injury.

Rose is sidelined with a bruised left elbow. He missed the second half of the Bulls' 103-100 victory over Houston on Thursday.

Rose said the elbow is getting better each day, but it remains tender. He was injured when he fell during the Bulls' 102-100 loss to Atlanta on Monday.

"Hurt, but I've just got to be smart," Rose said. "I'm out there playing with one hand."

Forward Taj Gibson is also not in the Bulls' starting lineup. Gibson is expected to miss his second consecutive game with a broken rib. He returned to the team Saturday after traveling to New York on Friday for a personal issue.

Bobby Portis is starting in place of Gibson. E'Twaun Moore is starting instead of Rose.
d8ed27ca-68a1-46d1-b29b-5ed5308d8b42  — LeBron James has moved past Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson into 11th place on the NBA's scoring list.

James scored on a layup when Atlanta's Al Horford was called for goaltending with 2:14 remaining in the third quarter of the Cleveland Cavaliers game at the Hawks on Friday night, giving him 26,711 points. James began the night 21 points behind Robertson's 26,710 points.

James moved past Robertson only one night after passing former Hawks Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins for 12th place.

James has also surpassed Jerry West, Reggie Miller, Alex English, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, John Havlicek and Tim Duncan on the scoring list this season.
3dfcdbcd-c5c6-48b0-87c0-df98b7403096  — Kristaps Porzingis will not play in the Knicks' game against Brooklyn because of a strained right shoulder that could end his rookie season.

Interim coach Kurt Rambis says the starting forward is day to day with six games remaining, but adds Friday that he and the medical staff would have to agree that Porzingis could safely play without fearing further injury.

Rambis says it would be "ridiculous of us as an organization" to play Porzingis if he wasn't healthy enough.

The No. 4 pick in the draft has averaged 14.3 points in 72 games, all starts. He didn't play Wednesday against Dallas after injuring the shoulder at New Orleans two days earlier.

Also, starting point guard Jose Calderon is out with a deep thigh bruise and Rambis says he will be out for a while.
0702536f-16d8-4bb0-8514-6684fbbc0435  — The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Bryce Cotton to a 10-day contract under the NBA's hardship roster rules.

The Grizzlies announced the deal Friday.

Memphis already has had 27 different players take the court this season, and Cotton playing will help the Grizzlies set the NBA record for most players to log minutes in a single season. The Grizzlies currently are tied with the 1996-97 Dallas Mavericks for the single-season record.

The 6-foot-1, 165 pound Cotton has played in 18 games with the Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns averaging 4.7 points and 1.0 assists in 10.7 minutes per game since going undrafted in 2014 after four seasons at Providence.

The Grizzlies, losers of four straight, host Toronto on Friday night holding the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference.
b64c56cf-b006-4adf-abca-0d68baf00a6f  — The Charlotte Hornets' Steve Clifford and the Golden State Warriors' Steve Kerr today were named the NBA Eastern and Western Conference Coaches of the Month, respectively, for games played in March.

Clifford led the Hornets to the East's best record at 13-3. The 13 wins are a Hornets franchise record for a month. Charlotte opened March with a seven-game winning streak during which their average margin of victory was 15.1 points. The Hornets ranked second in the Eastern Conference in scoring at 109.2 ppg, and their eight home wins improved their season tally to 27 -- third most in the conference.

Kerr guided the Warriors to the West's best record at 15-2. Golden State posted a seven-game winning streak from March 7-18 and closed the month on a six-game winning streak. The Warriors led the NBA in scoring at 114.0 ppg and ranked second in the Western Conference in field goal percentage at 47.9 percent. At 68-7, the Warriors have joined the 1995-96 and 1996-97 Chicago Bulls as the only teams to win 65 or more games in consecutive seasons.

Other nominees for Coach of the Month were Atlanta's Mike Budenholzer, Detroit's Stan Van Gundy, Miami's Erik Spoelstra, Oklahoma City's Billy Donovan, San Antonio's Gregg Popovich and Toronto's Dwane Casey.
0c80cc5a-46ca-45b3-b9b4-c514efa5d10d  — Los Angeles Lakers forward Julius Randle has been fined $15,000 for making an obscene gesture, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Randle's actions occurred with 1.9 seconds remaining in overtime of the Lakers' 102-100 victory over the Miami Heat on March 30 at Staples Center.
60b918c8-5fec-4e78-9f4e-b1e319f87c17  — Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins has been suspended for one game by the NBA after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season.

The league announced the punishment on Thursday. Under NBA rules, a player or coach is automatically suspended when he gets to 16 technical fouls during the regular season.

Cousins got his most recent technical in the final seconds of Sacramento's 120-111 win against Washington on Wednesday night. The All-Star will miss Friday's home game against Miami.
1c296aca-62ac-453b-bd10-b1ed2508e714  — LeBron James has moved past Dominique Wilkins into 12th place on the NBA's career scoring list.

James recorded a three-point play at the 3:52 mark of the first quarter of the Cleveland Cavaliers' 107-87 win over Brooklyn, giving him 26,671 career points. Wilkins had 26,668 during his Hall of Fame career with Atlanta, the Los Angeles Clippers, Boston, San Antonio and Orlando. James finished the game with 24 points, bringing his career total to 26.689.

James has also surpassed Jerry West, Reggie Miller, Alex English, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, John Havlicek and Tim Duncan on the scoring list this season.

James is likely to pass Oscar Robertson, who scored 26,710 career points, for 11th place on Friday night in Atlanta.
9c6360b1-71ea-4e1b-af15-92b8d68a5a25  — Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins has received a one-game suspension without pay for receiving his 16th technical foul of the 2015-16 season, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Under NBA rules, a player or coach is automatically suspended without pay for one game once he receives his 16th technical foul during a regular season. For every two additional technical fouls received during that regular season, the player or coach will be automatically suspended for an additional game.

Cousins received his most recent technical foul with 0:06 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Kings' 120-111 win over the Washington Wizards on March 30 at Sleep Train Arena. Cousins will serve his suspension on Friday, April 1 when Sacramento hosts the Miami Heat.
c5a118aa-7558-4887-8673-1a8640be71d9  — The Philadelphia 76ers are on a PR blitz trying to win fans' patience since they are unable to win on the court.

General manager Sam Hinkie - needing something to do with Jerry Colangelo now calling the shots - filmed a spot for the latest promotional video released Thursday that made it seem like he was stumping for votes on the campaign trail. Wearing a hard hat at the eventual site of their new team headquarters, Hinkie's voiceover says the team is moving "into a building that will embody a lot of the values important to us."

Hinkie and the 76ers even have a catchy campaign slogan: "Trust the Process."

The fans the organization is trying to woo could easily shoot back with a motto of their own: Win Some Games.

Year 3 of - Tanking? Rebuilding? You pick the side - is the worst one yet under owner Josh Harris, Hinkie and coach Brett Brown.

Hornets vs. Sixers Nicolas Batum has 19 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists for his second triple-double of the season, leading Charlotte to a 100-85 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night.

Worst of the NBA season? Well, yeah, that was inevitable in training camp. Worst of all time? Getting close.

The Sixers are 9-66 entering Friday's game at Charlotte, on pace to match the worst 82-game record in NBA history. Should the Sixers lose their final seven games, they will finish at 9-73, tying the miserable mark set by -- spoiler alert! -- the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1972-73 season.

The Sixers have lost 10 straight games and would finish on a 17-game losing streak should they fail to put another `W' in the column.

Under Brown, the Sixers have at one point lost both 26 and 28 straight games, the latter the longest losing streak in the history of pro sports.

Allen Iverson, expected to be named to the Hall of Fame on Monday, once railed against practice but is now preaching another p-word: Patience.

"I think in Philadelphia, real fans, you've got to be patient and understand how young these guys are and know that the potential is there," Iverson said. "The talent is there, they're just young, bro. We've got to give them a chance."

The dysfunctional Los Angeles Lakers are the next closest in the worst-of-the-worst teams with 16 wins.

The biggest win of the season just might come in the draft lottery, where this avalanche of defeats has the Sixers positioned to win the No. 1 pick.

But losing has come at a price, even for the greatest players in franchise history.

"If you're great here, you're a legend," Hinkie says in the video. "Wilt. Allen. Charles. You don't need a second name."

Sometimes, the legends don't need a first one.

Like Dr. J.

Julius Erving, the Hall of Famer who starred on the 76ers' last title team in 1983, is tired of watching the franchise founder at the bottom of the NBA.

Sixers vs. Warriors Klay Thompson goes off for 40 points as the Warriors beat the 76ers 117-105.

"It hurts to see the franchise down," Erving said. "We want to be associated with a winning team. We've got to take crap from other retired players from teams that are winning right now. Then we have to remind them how we used to beat up on them in our day. It's a little bit back and forth. There's bragging rights. We'd like for the Sixers to help us get some bragging rights."

There are the infamous kind of bragging rights, as well.

Fred Carter, who played on that 1972-73 Sixers team and would coach the team in the 1990s, said this year's team is worse than the 70s edition because of how open the franchise has been about the plan to hit bottom. Carter said his Sixers were not built for losing; it just sort of happened.

Carter wants the Sixers to win at least one more game so the `73 team will continue to hold the dubious mark.

"Sunday, I'll go to Mass. Sunday, I'll light an extra candle for them," he said, laughing. "I don't know if I'll be lighting a candle for them or lighting one for me, but I will light one. It's better to be remembered than not remembered at all."

This season's Sixers would rather not go down as the worst of all time.

"Most of the games we're in, we've been able to put up a game," forward Nerlens Noel said.

So, can a team that had Christian Wood, Sonny Weems and even Elton Brand suit up this season avoid a single-digit victory season?

Let's take a look:

- Friday, at Charlotte: The Hornets lead the series 3-0 and just thumped the Sixers 100-85 on Tuesday.

- Saturday, vs. Pacers: The Pacers lead the series 2-0 and will play the Sixers on the second night of back-to-backs.

- Tuesday, vs. New Orleans: "Ahhh, that's their 10!" Carter said. "They shut down Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. That'll get them 10."

Carter might be right. The woeful Pelicans (27-47) won in their only other meeting but have benched their injured stars for the season, meaning this could be Philly's best shot at the 10th win.

- Friday, April 8, vs New York: Pro: It's the Knicks. Con: New York leads the series 3-0.

Then it's games against the Bucks, Raptors and Bulls, teams that are a combined 8-0 vs. the 76ers this season.

There could be hope in the franchise's bloodlines - four seasons after the nine-win team, the 76ers reached the NBA Finals and they won it all 10 years later.

Can they find that franchise savior in the draft?

"Allen Iverson ain't walking through the door," Iverson said.

And the suffering continues.
ceff1073-7cf2-4aa5-a6a0-21a13d9146a4  — The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Jordan Farmar (FAHR-mahr) for the rest of this season.

The Grizzlies announced the move Thursday.

The 6-foot-2, 180-pound Farmar has started three of five games since signing a 10-day contract with Memphis on March 21, and he has averaged 10.8 points and 3.6 assists. Farmar, 29, has played in 495 games over nine seasons with the Lakers, Nets, Clippers and now the Grizzlies.

Farmar originally was the 26th draft selection by the Lakers in 2006 out of UCLA.

The Grizzlies have been without point guard Mike Conley since his last game March 6 because of Achilles tendinitis in his left foot. They currently hold the No. 5 spot in the Western Conference with seven games remaining.
836f8a3d-2c8c-4bc7-a204-d960634d1513  — Four fans trying to get an autograph from Stephen Curry fell out of the stands when a railing dislodged before the Utah Jazz hosted the Golden State Warriors.

Curry had just finished his pregame routine, which draws many fans at Warriors games, when he stopped to take a picture and sign a few autographs at the opening of the tunnel.

A large number of fans lined the stands surrounding the tunnel, holding jerseys and other paraphernalia for Curry to sign. As he did, a railing dislodged and four fans, including three minors, fell onto the floor at Curry's feet.

One fan went to first aid on his own and the other three were treated, released and returned to their seats.

Curry autographed an item for the three fans that did not leave the scene.

Jazz spokesman Frank Zang said the team will re-evaluate the safety measures around the court.
42a0579e-bd3b-41d7-8821-cb99121306e1  — Chris Paul is passing up a shot at Olympic history to take a much-needed summer off.

The Los Angeles Clippers star said it was a difficult decision to pull his name from consideration for this summer's Olympics in Rio, but after spending a decade playing for USA Basketball he felt it was time for a breather.

"I've been playing every summer for the past 10-11 years," Paul said at the team's shootaround Wednesday morning as the Clippers prepared to play the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I feel like I have a right to choose my family every now and then, too."

Chris Paul Team USA Replacement? CP3 says he needs to take the summer off from basketball, so who shall replace him? The Starters discuss.

Paul won gold in Beijing in 2008 and in London in 2012, when he made every start. Had he returned to Rio, he could have joined LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony as the only men's basketball players in Olympic history to win three gold medals.

He is very close with Anthony, James and Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade. The point guard said he consulted all three friends before making the decision. Anthony has indicated he wants to play in Rio, while James has yet to commit, saying as late as last week that he hasn't had many discussions about it.

Paul also consulted his family and management team before making the decision. He will turn 31 in May and said the prospects of having a summer free to spend time with his children and family weighed heavily.

"It was a tough decision," Paul said. "It's a long story. My kids have never had an opportunity to experience the Olympics. Little Chris was so excited about it. But I talked to him and was like, `I actually get a chance to be home a little bit more.' "

USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Tuesday that Paul's choice did not come as a surprise, with Paul indicating as early as January he was having reservations about making another run. The talent pool is also well-stocked at point guard, with Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, John Wall, Kyrie Irving and Mike Conley all among the pool of players for the Americans.

The final roster for the August games will be selected in June.
4a65fbce-5005-4e25-90ca-c10c866d0118  — The Sacramento Kings have signed general manager and vice president of basketball operations Vlade Divac to a new multiyear contract.

The team announced the move to keep Divac in the role running the franchise on Wednesday. Divac originally joined the front office last March, oversaw most of the offseason moves and was officially named to his current position in August.

Divac said he looks forward to building a winning team in Sacramento. The Kings (29-45) are headed to their 10th straight season without a playoff berth and face uncertainty this offseason about the status of coach George Karl.

The team moves into a new downtown arena next season and has a major building block in place in All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins.
314f2c8a-4fd6-4c72-b848-38ab6a043f0e  — D'Angelo Russell believes he must rebuild the Los Angeles Lakers' trust in him after the rookie guard's unflattering video exchange with teammate Nick Young ended up on social media.

Speaking before Wednesday night's home game against Miami, Russell apologized profusely for recording the video, saying his actions have created "a bad vibe" on the last-place club.

He also acknowledged that the video might have imperiled Young's relationship with his fiancee, rapper Iggy Azalea.

"I feel as sick as possible," Russell said. "I wish I could make things better right away, but I can't."

In Russell's video, he asks Young about being with women other than Azalea. The 20-year-old Russell said he has no idea how the video became public, claiming he didn't post it on social media or send it to any friends.

"That's the two-and-two I'm trying to put together, me and my team," said Russell, who also declined to blame the leak on phone hacking. "I have no clue how that got out."

Russell disagreed with claims that his teammates have isolated him, but he knows they aren't happy.

"I know if I've lost anybody's trust, I'm going to work my tail off to gain it back, because that's something you need for a winning team," Russell said. "You need everybody to trust each other. You need the first guy to trust the 15th guy, and that's my intentions."

Young was unusually downbeat in his own brief comments before Wednesday's game. The charismatic veteran guard has mostly played poorly this season for the Lakers, his hometown team.

"I don't want to get into my personal life right now," Young said. "I think it's best me and D'Angelo handle the situation we have in a private manner, outside the media. I think it's something we really do need to sit down and talk about. That's about it. What happened is what happened. We've got to work on it."

Azalea's wedding to Young had been postponed even before the video drama. The Australian pop star posted an interesting response on her Twitter account: "hmmm i see D Angelo Russell is trending... I actually liked his film. Thanks bro."

Russell said he intended the video to be a joke between two easygoing players. Young is among Russell's closest friends on the team, with Russell claiming they usually share a mischievous attitude toward life and locker-room antics.

"He's one of the guys that I've always talked to about anything, and I cherished our friendship," Russell said. "And for me to have an incident like this come up and put it in jeopardy is not what I was intending to do."

Lakers coach Byron Scott agreed that the controversy is likely to hurt his team's trust in Russell, a pillar of the Lakers' rebuilding effort. Even before the video drama, Scott publicly questioned the maturity level of Russell, who is averaging 13.1 points, 3.4 assists and 3.4 rebounds this season.

Young hasn't played for the Lakers in 10 straight games, but is under contract for next season with a player option for 2017-18.

The video flap is just the latest tawdry mistake by a roster that sits 29th in the overall NBA standings, leading only Philadelphia.

Earlier this month, Young and starting guard Jordan Clarkson were embarrassed when a woman claimed they had made inappropriate, harassing gestures at her while their cars were stopped at a traffic light in Hollywood, leading the players to claim the incident was "a miscommunication."

Kobe Bryant's farewell season also has been a disaster on the court for the Lakers, who are 15-59 heading into their meeting with the Heat. They're wrapping up the worst three-season stretch in club history after last season's Lakers went 21-61, setting the franchise record for losses and worst winning percentage.

Russell acknowledged saying "crazy things" in his daily conversations with Young, but claimed the video wasn't a prank gone wrong.

"At this point, the damage has been done," Russell said. "The best thing you can do is own up to it. That's what I did, and I'm owning up to it to full effect, and just taking what comes with it."
e0fd7b8c-8455-48f4-9b4d-1c3549f31f81  Hawks vs. Raptors (7:30 ET, NBA TV)

Beasts Of The East

Two of the top three teams in the Eastern Conference square off on NBA TV tonight. The No. 2 seed Raptors hold a 2-0 season series lead over the No. 3 seed Hawks, with their most recent victory coming less than three weeks ago in Toronto. However, that loss was only the third since February 26 for the Hawks, who have the second best record in the league (14-3) over this span. An Atlanta win tonight would pull them within 4.0 games of the Raptors with six games to play, including another matchup with the Raptors on April 7. It's a long shot, but stranger things have happened.

Hawks vs. Raptors DeMar DeRozan scores 30 points as the Raptors defeat the Hawks 104-96.

Tough Stretch

The Raptors have lost three of their last four games, which is their worst four-game stretch since mid-December. They were dominated by the Thunder on Monday for just their ninth loss at home this season (28-9 overall) and will try to bounce back against a Hawks team that touts the top defensive rating in the league since January 1. The Raptors have talked all year about the importance of finishing the season strong, so look for them to be extremely motivated to snap out of their funk in front of their home crowd tonight. Despite their recent struggles, the Raptors trail the Cavaliers by only 2.5 games for the No. 1 seed in the East.

Hawks Attack

Two of the Hawks' usual leaders, Paul Millsap and Jeff Teague, have struggled against the Raptors this season with a combined shooting percentage of 29 percent in two losses. Ball movement is always the key for the Hawks' offense as they rank second in the league in assist percentage (66.3 percent). Toronto, meanwhile, ranks last in assist percentage (50.6 percent) while having a more efficient offense than the Hawks. Tune in tonight to see which offensive style prevails as both teams look to finish the last two weeks of the regular season strong.

Heat vs. Lakers (10:30 ET, NBA TV)

Wade vs. Kobe

Arguably the two greatest guards of this generation face off for the final time tonight in Los Angeles. Dwyane Wade has the edge over Kobe Bryant in head-to-head matchups with a record of 11-8. In these 19 games, Bryant averaged 27.3 points on 44.1 percent shooting and 4.9 assists while Wade posted 24.2 points on 44.8 percent shooting and 6.6 assists. Be sure not miss these two legends matchup for the final time. You never know what will happen when they step on the floor.

Climbing The Standings

The Heat enter tonight's matchup just 1.0 game behind the Hawks for the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference and 0.5 games ahead of Boston and Charlotte. Miami has sizzled over the last two months with the fourth best record in the league since January 25 (20-9). They have been without Chris Bosh (blood clots) for the last 20 games, but have actually been stronger on offense without the All-Star. Since Bosh went down, the Heat have posted the third best offensive rating in the league (up from 24th with Bosh). Joe Johnson has been solid with averages of 12.8 points on 51.4 percent shooting, 3.5 assists and 3.0 rebounds in 32.0 minutes since coming over from the Nets in mid-February.

Eight Games Left

The Kobe Bryant farewell tour has flown by and now only eight games remain before the Lakers legend says goodbye to the game. Tonight will mark his fourth last game at Staples Center, so you know the building will be electric. Unfortunately for Bryant and his fans, the young Lakers have struggled mightily this season. On Monday, Utah defeated L.A. by 48 points to tie the largest margin of defeat in Lakers franchise history. The Lakers must finish the season 7-1 to avoid setting a new record for worst season in franchise history, which they set last season at 21-61. Despite their struggles, they have been a fun team to watch during Bryant's farewell tour as young studs D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson all have the ability to show flashes of brilliance.

NBA.com staff reports
b2807888-82f3-47c1-ab28-5d4610fa7f25  — The Sioux Falls Skyforce have set the NBA Development League record for wins in a season, getting their 39th on Tuesday by topping the Iowa Energy 125-107.

The Skyforce, an affiliate of the Miami Heat, are 39-9 with two games remaining. The previous D-League record for wins was 38, set by the Los Angeles D-Fenders in 2011-12.

"I'm proud of the group," Skyforce coach Dan Craig told The Associated Press by phone after the game. "The guys have done a tremendous job of just buying in and being selfless as a team. Any given night, it could be somebody's night. From day one until now, it's been team-first. And this milestone, I reminded the team it's something no one can take away from you and we certainly don't take it for granted."

Jarnell Stokes and DeAndre Liggins each scored 23 for Sioux Falls in the record-setter.

"I'm thrilled for D.C.," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week when asked Craig, who has been close with for more than a decade. "D.C.'s one of my closest people on this planet, so I'm absolutely thrilled for him this year. What he's showing is that he's an excellent basketball coach."

The Heat pay for and control the basketball operations for the Skyforce, who have local ownership led by Greg Heineman and his family to handle their off-the-court business matters. The Skyforce run a system very similar to the Heat, and Craig was a Heat assistant before taking over the D-League club this season.

"What we've set up now in Sioux Falls, and it's been three years in the making, but now it is an absolute mirror of what we're trying to do," Spoelstra said. "It's gotten a little bit better as we've gotten to know (more) each year. And he's bringing a lot of what he wants to do to the table as well. It's awesome."

At this time last year, Craig was on Spoelstra's staff, flying on charters and staying in five-star hotels with the Heat. The D-League doesn't come close to comparing in that sense, and Craig never complained when Heat President Pat Riley and Spoelstra came to him with this offer.

"It's a healthy challenge for me as a person, as a leader, as a coach," Craig said. "I embraced this opportunity. I'm very thankful to Coach Riley, Coach Spoelstra, (Heat general manager) Andy Elisburg, for those guys to offer me the opportunity. This is a first-class organization. It's funny how similar the Heat and the Skyforce are."

Craig said the Skyforce have taken a team-first approach all season, which isn't necessarily easy to do in the D-League - with players hoping to get noticed and get to the next level.

He thinks that will continue now, with the playoffs coming and the Skyforce now able to start thinking about chasing a title.

"These guys are excited about that opportunity," Craig said. "They're focused on that, so we can be playing the best basketball going into the playoffs."
f32c60ea-84a6-4d6d-90c4-7e9760fef6a3  — Craig Sager has a blood clot behind his right ear that is affecting his hearing, and that's just another annoyance he is accepting as he continues to work NBA games for Turner Sports with fervor despite his leukemia no longer being in remission.

Dealing with the clot, which Sager compared to swimmer's ear that won't subside, could cause him to bleed to death given his blood levels, he said.

Sager's spirits are undeterred by the latest challenge in his cancer fight, even if it meant a redeye flight after Tuesday's Wizards-Warriors game to get to a doctor's appointment in Houston on Wednesday morning before another game Thursday. His new reality includes twice-weekly blood work and regular transfusions, the latest done Monday in Atlanta before he flew West.

"Nice to be here, that's for sure," said Sager, who stood up and saluted Steve Kerr as the Warriors coach discussed the one-of-a-kind broadcaster before the game. "I always get here over three hours before tip. It's fun."

Sager waved when he received a standing ovation and cheers from one large section of Oracle Arena as he walked along the baseline during a fourth-quarter timeout.

Craig Sager's Most Memorable Moments The loud clothing made for colorful moments with NBA players - The Starters have put together the most memorable moments in Craig Sager's TV career. Watch The Starters weekdays at 700ET on NBATV and get more of them on their website: http://nba.com/thestarters

For the occasion of covering the defending NBA champions, Sager purchased a new outfit - wearing a "Golden Gate Bridge" orange sport coat and shirt with a bright tie that lists its 15 colors on the back. His special Nike sneakers say "Mr. Fancy" inside the tongue of the left shoe and "Suits" on the right one.

"Excited to see him," Kerr said. "Thinking a lot about Sager and his family, and there he is. ... Fired up you're working the game, Sags."

Oh, and for anyone wondering how he's holding up emotionally, Sager said defiantly: "I think my demise has been prematurely reported. I think I'm going to kick this and make medical history and I really believe that."

The 64-year-old is set to work Thursday in Houston, where he receives his chemotherapy treatments - eight days of chemo coming soon starting the final week of the regular season and into the first week of the playoffs.

"I got a bag of platelets and a blood transfusion. It kind of pumped me up, got me going," Sager said of Monday's trip to the hospital. "It's like having an old car. You've got to put gas in it. If it's leaking oil, you've got to put oil in it every day, too."

If all goes well during Wednesday's checkup, Sager figures he won't have to go back until Friday for more blood work.

"Obviously not good but it's keeping me going. I have no choice," he said.

Sager said there's "no doubt about it" that he'll work through the playoffs. He hopes to be assigned to San Antonio in the first round so he can go back and forth to Houston.

"He's a battler. He's going to fight this tooth and nail, that's who he is and that's who he's got to stay," said Wizards coach Randy Wittman, who as a player in Atlanta met Sager and later had a business with him.

Sager also is taking on some duties as a spokesman for leukemia awareness. Whatever he can do to help in a cause that needs more attention, he said.

#SagerStrong The Starters show their support for Craig Sager, who continues to fight a battle with cancer.

Warriors assistant Jarron Collins found Sager with a hug outside Kerr's office, and injured Golden State big man Festus Ezeli wrapped his arm around Sager courtside. Sager chatted up reigning MVP Stephen Curry, of course.

"It's obviously been very surprising and overwhelming the support I've gotten," Sager said. "So many times when you're doing a job you feel like you're nuisance sometimes to people and you're intruding on their space and you're asking questions maybe they don't want to deal with at the time and it's not as, `Hey, welcome, here's Craig.' Whereas now it's kind of been different. I've always been one I've always liked to talk to people in the stands. I understand when people come up to me and say somebody in their family has cancer, `We appreciate what you're doing, we appreciate your fight, don't give up, we love your attitude.' That's just me. I've never had one day where I said, `Why me?' and I've never had one day where I laid in my bed and thought about what reality and the worst things are and was down and started crying in my bed. That's never happened."

He misses his daily runs, especially along the water in San Francisco. His tender feet and energy levels make it difficult. Sager did get some golf in last weekend with his kids, and "took their money, played pretty well, I was very happy. I'm not hitting it as far but I'm still playing pretty good."

Sager has earned his doctors' trust over the past two years going through this that he can handle being out, traveling and working on his craft.

"I tell them, `No, I've got to go,"' he said. "I'd go crazy if I just sat around and tried to make sure I didn't bleed or get cut. I've got to be myself and go do what I have to do that keeps me going. It keeps me motivated. It's therapeutic."
9078e06b-901a-4ff9-8836-ff3968dbdba6  Chris Paul won't play for the U.S. basketball team in this summer's Olympics, passing up a chance for a third gold medal.

Paul played for the U.S. in 2008 and 2012 and could have joined LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony in trying to become the first men's players to win three Olympic basketball golds.

"He's made a major contribution to USA Basketball. I think he was great for us and I think it was good for him to be part of what we did, and we're appreciative of that," USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Tuesday.

"That's the way it should be when a player gets to a point and makes a decision that it might not be best to push it, to push the envelope as you get on in your career, and so we respect that decision."

Colangelo said Paul, who started every game for the Americans in London, had indicated a couple of months ago he might not be up for the trip to Rio, but wanted more time to consider it.

"I think when we spoke in January my feeling was he probably wouldn't," Colangelo said. "I think the season, as you mature in your career or age, it takes its toll. It just does."

Paul, who will turn 31 in May, played for the Americans as a rookie in the 2006 world basketball championship before winning Olympic golds in Beijing and London. The Clippers' All-Star told Sports Illustrated, which first reported his decision Tuesday, that, "I feel my body telling me that I could use the time."

It's the second major loss for the Americans, as Anthony Davis was forced to pull out recently with knee and shoulder injuries. But 29 players remain in their roster pool, with Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Damian Lillard and Mike Conley among the remain point guard choices.

"One thing I would tell you is the guard position is one of our strong suits, so this opens up an opportunity for someone who might not otherwise have been considered to be one of those," Colangelo said.

Colangelo added he hasn't heard from James and Anthony, Paul's close friends. James hasn't made his decision, though Anthony has indicated he wants to play.

The U.S. plans to pick its team in late June.
f93d0fb2-3809-44a1-b05e-8bdb3fce7252  — Houston Rockets forward Montrezl Harrell has been suspended five games without pay in the NBA Development League for pushing a referee to the floor during an altercation.

Also, Bakersfield forward Derek Cooke Jr. was suspended one game without pay for pushing Harrell during the skirmish in a game Saturday.

It happened right after Bakersfield completed a 119-115 victory over Rio Grande, where Harrell is on assignment from the Rockets. The National Basketball Referees Association had called for a multiple-game suspension, saying Harrell committed "deliberate assault and battery" against the referee.

Harrell is ineligible to be recalled by the Rockets until he has completed his D-League suspension, which he began serving Tuesday.
7aac929a-3a39-400c-bd4f-404906771648  — The National Basketball Association (NBA) announced today that NBA Global Games China 2016 presented by Master Kong will feature two preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing between the Houston Rockets and the New Orleans Pelicans.

The Rockets and Pelicans will play Oct. 9 in Shanghai at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, followed by a rematch in Beijing on Oct. 12 at The LeSports Center.

The 10th edition of NBA Global Games China will celebrate the Rockets' first visit to Shanghai since their inaugural game there in 2004, when NBA Legend Yao Ming played in his hometown of Shanghai for the first time in his NBA career in front of a sold-out crowd. NBA Global Games China 2016 will mark the Pelicans' first visit to China.

NBA Global Games China 2016 will feature a variety of off-court activities, including the fifth Fan Appreciation Day presented by Dongfeng Nissan on Oct. 7 in Shanghai, which will provide thousands of fans with the opportunity to participate in oncourt games and watch the Rockets and Pelicans showcase their skills. The league will also conduct NBA Cares and Jr. NBA community events and league partners will host interactive fan activities.

32f83da3-2077-42a1-8f43-b56af7e0599d  — The Oklahoma City Thunder are resting star Kevin Durant and starting forward Serge Ibaka for Tuesday night's game against the Detroit Pistons.

Coach Billy Donovan says the Thunder thought this was a good chance to rest the two players after Oklahoma City played at Toronto the previous night. The Thunder have clinched the Northwest Division title, and they are almost certain to end up with the Western Conference's third-best record at the end of the regular season.

Oklahoma City has won eight straight.

The Pistons catch a break with Durant and Ibaka out of the lineup. Detroit enters Tuesday night's game with a 2 1/2-game lead in the race for the final playoff spot in the East.
79367000-f12d-4e4d-99ef-c060d9aa75f7  — The Pelicans say guard Jrue Holiday and forward Alonzo Gee will miss the rest of this season because of injuries, joining a slew of sidelined New Orleans teammates.

Both Holiday and Gee were injured in Monday night's victory over the New York Knicks.

The Pelicans, who issued medical updates Tuesday, say Holiday's orbital eyewall was fractured when he was hit by an apparently inadvertent elbow from Kristaps Porzingis. The club says Gee ruptured a muscle in his right thigh.

Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, and guards Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon and Bryce Dejean-Jones, already had been shut down for the season.

Meanwhile, the Pelicans say forward Ryan Anderson has been diagnosed with a sports hernia and is seeking a second opinion, and that Norris Cole remains day-to-day with back soreness.
bbaedbe2-ffac-4cec-8601-28d580a94b55  — LeBron James has found a golfing partner to help local youth.

The NBA star's family foundation and the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational are teaming up to help educate students and enhance their interest in golf.

The tournament is pledging $50,000 from charity proceeds to fund various programs for students. They will have the opportunity to take outings to a TV affiliate to experience being an anchor, hit golf shots at a simulator of Firestone's signature "monster" 16th hole and get behind-the-scenes tours at the tournament site.

The Bridgestone Invitational is being held from June 27 to July 3.
6d37f904-343a-460e-a495-1ba376fa8046  — Carmelo Anthony says he was momentarily "shocked" when he felt someone grasping at his thigh as he stood near the top of the key in the final minute of the New York Kicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night.

When he saw it was a young boy who'd somehow slipped through courtside security to give him a hug, his instinct was to react with an affectionate pat on the head.

"It was a little kid," Anthony said when explaining his friendly response. "I was shocked. I didn't really know who was it until I actually looked over and saw that it was a kid."

The boy ran onto the court during a stoppage in play with the Knicks on their offensive end, then was shooed back off the court by game official Kevin Cutler.

The chief of arena security at the Smoothie King Center, Russ Bourgeois, declined to comment on the incident. So it was not immediately clear if the boy or his guardian were cited in any way or removed from the building.

In New York City, the so-called "Calvin Klein Law" subjects those who walk onto the court during a game to arrest and fines. The law was passed in 2003 after fashion designer Calvin Klein walked onto the court at Madison Square Garden and attempted to chat with Knicks player Latrell Sprewell.

"I think it was because he was a little kid, they just let him go," Anthony said. "Definitely a security issue though, for sure."

The boy ran back into the stands and up stairs past an apparent female guardian, who, looking embarrassed, appeared to usher him toward the exits.
ee7b534b-884d-4578-b504-cbe9cdce8882  — Vince Boryla, a former player, coach and general manager in the NBA, died Sunday. He was 89.

The death was confirmed by the Denver Nuggets and the University of Denver, where he's a member of the school's Hall of Fame.

Before the Nuggets' game against Dallas on Monday night, the team held a moment of silence to honor its former general manager. Boryla orchestrated a blockbuster deal with Portland in 1984 that brought Wayne Cooper, Fat Lever and Calvin Natt to town for Kiki Vandeweghe. Denver made it to the Western Conference finals that season and Boryla was named the NBA's Executive of the Year.

Boryla played five seasons for the New York Knicks in the 1950s and averaged 11.2 points. He later took over as their coach for three seasons, going 80-85.

The Knicks and Nuggets each posted pictures of Boryla on their Twitter accounts, with the Nuggets adding: "Vince Boryla, our former GM and 1984-85 NBA Executive of the Year, passed away yesterday. RIP, Moose."

Boryla also was a member of the U.S. team that won a gold medal at the 1948 Olympics.

Boryla is the only consensus All-American for the University of Denver in men's basketball history. In 2013, the program renamed the Pioneer Award to the Vince Boryla '49 Pioneer Award. It's presented to the player who takes the extra step to make the program better.

He's survived by his wife, Mary Jo, and five children, along with numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren.
1f0a09ec-4940-4299-bf49-766247443ced  — New Orleans Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday, who has missed two games with a toe injury on his left foot, is returning to the lineup for Monday night's game against the New York Knicks.

Coach Alvin Gentry says the injury is still nagging Holiday, but he's ready to "give it a go."

Holiday has scored 20 or more points in seven of his previous 10 games, including three games with at least 30. His play has been among the few bright spots for the injury-decimated Pelicans, who entered Monday with a 26-46 record.

Forward Ryan Anderson, who has missed four games with groin soreness in both legs, and guard Norris Cole, who has missed 10 games back soreness, remain out against the Knicks.
7dd3568f-87f8-4354-ac66-9a8f3e5e6486  — Maybe the Charlotte Hornets are catching Curry fever.

The Hornets, who play about 20 miles from where sharpshooter Stephen Curry starred at Davidson College and who employ Stephen's long-distance shooting father Dell as a broadcaster, are suddenly one of the NBA's hottest shooting 3-point teams.

The seemingly playoff-bound Hornets (42-31) are averaging 10.6 made 3-pointers per game, second only to Curry's Golden State Warriors. Behind the improved shooting of fifth-year point guard Kemba Walker and a revamped roster, the Hornets are hitting 36.3 percent from beyond the arc -- sixth-best in the league.

That's hard to fathom considering just last season the Hornets finished last in the NBA in 3-point shooting efficiency, making just 31 percent.

But an offseason spent revamping the roster by adding long-distance shooters and players with an ability to penetrate and open up the outside game has paid off.

"We have guys with chips on their shoulders; guys with a lot to prove," Walker said. "For myself I know I had to get my percentages up."

He's done that.

Walker is shooting a career-best 37.9 percent from 3-point range, a marked increase from the 31.7 percent he made during his first four seasons.

Veteran power forward Marvin Williams has also elevated his long-distance game, shooting a career-best 40.2 percent on 3s. Walker, Williams and Nicolas Batum all rank in the top 25 in the league in 3-pointers made.

The Hornets are getting smaller, but still significant contributions from rookie 7-foot power forward Frank Kaminsky, and guards Jeremy Lin, Jeremy Lamb and Courtney Lee, all new to the team this season. Charlotte is assured of a winning season, and they had the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference entering Monday night.

The additions of Lin and Lamb have helped open up more shots because of their ability to penetrate.

"They can make plays off the dribble and draw defenders and get an open guy the basketball and make an open shot," Walker said. "And we have guys like Marvin (Williams) and Frank (Kaminsky) who can stretch the floor out. There's a lot of spacing, so I feel like spacing attributes" to the improved shooting.

Third-year coach Steve Clifford is all for the Hornets letting it fly, although he preaches the importance of his team working inside-out and making sure the ball reaches the paint before any shots go up on most possessions.

When Clifford was an assistant coach under Stan Van Gundy in Orlando, the Magic were known for playing four-in, one-out basketball -- and knocking down 3s.

So Clifford is comfortable playing that style.

"I think that worked for Mike D'Antoni, who gets a lot of credit for that, and also Stan," Clifford said. "Stan is doing that same thing in Detroit. I think a lot of the things that we do are things I learned from them."

The Hornets haven't had small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist except for seven games this season.

While they miss his defense, hustle and ability to get to the basket, Kidd-Gilchrist has never been considered a dangerous long-distance shooter. In fact, he didn't even attempt a 3-pointer in 55 games last season.

With Batum playing the 3-spot and Williams at the four, the Hornets are getting more offensive production from long range. Williams has made 135 3-pointers this season and Batum 133.

But Walker's improvement is most noticeable.

He's made 158 3-pointers, 14th-most in the league and by far the most of his budding career. He said he's shooting the ball with a confidence he hasn't had since his final year at Connecticut, when he led the Huskies to a national championship.

"Over the last couple of years, as far as consistency, it just hasn't worked out for me. This year it has," Walker said. "Just the guys that we have helped as well with spreading the floor out and me seeing the basketball go through the net early in the season has given me confidence. I'm trying to stay confident."
0f7627b8-00d2-4bd5-8ca7-001f1824817e  — LeBron James will sit out Tuesday's game against Houston (8 p.m. ET, TNT) to get some extra rest as the Cavaliers begin gearing up for the NBA playoffs.

James kept his schedule secret on Monday, deferring to coach Tyronn Lue, who then divulged that he will rest his superstar against the Rockets.

The Cavs played Saturday, and with no game until Thursday, James will have four consecutive days to relax. The 31-year-old has sat out three previous games this season.

James was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the 52nd time in his career. He averaged 29 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.8 assists as the Cavs went 3-1 and maintained their lead over Toronto for the best record in the Eastern Conference.

James capped his week with a triple-double - 27 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists - in a win over New York.
de09219a-7978-4b45-9c01-8fcfa398422e  — The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson today were named NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for games played Monday, March 21 through Sunday, March 27.

James helped the Cavaliers to a 3-1 week with averages of 29.0 points (first in the Eastern Conference), 8.8 assists (second in the conference) and 8.5 rebounds. James bookended the week with triple-doubles in wins over the Denver Nuggets on March 21 and New York Knicks on March 26. In all four of Cleveland's games, James scored 25-plus points, grabbed five or more rebounds and handed out five or more assists. James' Cavaliers sit atop the Eastern Conference with a 52-21 record.

Thompson led the Warriors to a 4-0 week behind an NBA-best 32.3 points. He shot 62.2 percent (28-of-45) from distance and made at least five three-pointers in each of Golden State's four games. Thompson closed the week with back-to-back 40-point games in wins over the Dallas Mavericks on March 25 and Philadelphia 76ers on March 27. Thompson's Warriors own the league's best record at 66-7.

Here is a recap of the week for James and Thompson:

f09c0009-4b6a-4602-9897-5796c0629ae8  Hawks vs. Bulls (8 ET, NBA TV)

Taking Flight

The Hawks have been dominant over the last month, posting the second best record in the league, 13-3, since February 26. Atlanta is fueled by their defense, which ranks No. 1 in the league since January 1. The Hawks will look to keep this league-leading defense going against the Bulls, who Atlanta is 3-0 against this season. A win tonight would mark the Hawks' first season sweep over the Bulls since 2008-09. To avoid the sweep, Chicago will need to slow down Al Horford, who has torched the Bulls for an average of 22.3 points on 69.8 percent shooting, 6.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.3 blocks in three games this season.

Falling Fast

As Atlanta climbs the Eastern Conference standings, Chicago is tumbling down and looks to be on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007-08. The Bulls are 14-24 since January 9, which is the 23rd worst record in the league over that span. By comparison, Chicago was 22-12 on the season before this dismal stretch. Chicago hasn't been good on either side of the ball since January 9, ranking sixth worst in offensive rating and seventh worst in defensive rating. A return to the United Center tonight should help the Bulls some as they are 24-13 there this season and 8 of their last 11 overall. However, the Hawks have won six of their last seven on the road and beat the Bulls in Chicago on February 10.

Bulls Woes The GameTime crew discuss what is wrong with the Bulls as they chase a playoff spot.

Playoff Implications

Both teams need a win tonight to keep pace in the crowded Eastern Conference. The Hawks have vaulted to the No. 3 seed, but trail No. 2 seed Toronto by 6.0 games, so it appears No. 3 is as high as they can climb. The Hawks have a 0.5 game lead over Boston, 1.0 game lead over Miami and 1.5 game lead over No. 6 seed Charlotte. This four-team grouping likely will be the No. 3-6 seeds when the season ends on April 14, so every game matters for Atlanta as they hope to stay in either the No. 3 or 4 seeds to secure home-court advantage in the first round. On the other side, Chicago enters tonight's action in the No. 9 seed, 2.0 games behind No. 8 seed Detroit and 2.5 games behind No. 7 seed Indiana. A loss tonight would make the road even steeper for Chicago as they look to climb back into the race with 10 games to go.

Celtics vs. Clippers (10:30 ET, NBA TV)

Eyes On Atlanta

After a four-game losing streak, the Celtics have rediscovered their groove and strung together four straight wins heading into tonight's game in Los Angeles. They fall into the same four-team group as the Hawks, Heat and Hornets. They sit in the No. 4 seed now, but could jump the Hawks for the No. 3 seed with a win and an Atlanta loss tonight. In their lone matchup with the Clippers this season, Boston won in an overtime thriller, 139-134. Isaiah Thomas led the Celtics with 36 points (on 12-for-21 shooting) and 11 assists, while Jared Sullinger added 21 points (on 10-for-15) and 11 rebounds. Will these two players be able to have a repeat performance tonight?

Playoffs Clinched

The Clippers punched their ticket to the postseason with Sunday's win over the Nuggets. They hold a commanding, 4.5 game lead over the No. 5 seed Grizzlies and trail the No. 3 seed Thunder by 5.5 games. So, the No. 4 seed is likely where the Clippers will remain for the final two-plus weeks of the regular season. Defense has been the key for L.A. since Blake Griffin went down with injury on Christmas Day. In the 42 games since Griffin's injury, the Clippers have the fourth best defensive rating in the league and will look to keep it up once Griffin returns to the lineup later this week. Griffin was medically cleared to return to action on Sunday and served the first of his four-game suspension during the Clippers' win over Denver. If everything goes according to plan, Griffin will be back in the lineup against the Wizards on Sunday, April 3.

bcd53c70-aa5f-4fd2-9def-7e4e2e322b2c  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

a7aa9ccb-7af0-4dfa-8831-a0c54a66bd0f  — The NBA says referees were correct in not calling a foul against Golden State on Memphis' final possession, when a score by the Grizzlies could have ended the Warriors' bid for a record 73 victories.

Lance Stephenson missed twice in the closing seconds Saturday as the Warriors held on for a 100-99 victory that made them 71-9 with two games remaining. Commentators said Stephenson may have been fouled on the second one, when he launched a contested jumper from the corner that hit the side of the backboard.

But in its review of the last 2 minutes Sunday, the league says that both Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry maintained a legal guarding position on Stephenson's initial drive. Both players then made contact with Stephenson when he regained the ball and shot his jumper, but the league says that Stephenson created the incidental contact with Thompson by kicking his leg out, and that Curry made only incidental contact with Stephenson after the shot was taken.
1eb789e8-c0d2-4fc4-8049-54dd8193c9ab  — Philadelphia 76ers owner Josh Harris returned for a state-of-the franchise address with a new Colangelo by his side.

Hired in December, Jerry Colangelo is already out as chairman of basketball operations.

Enter Bryan Colangelo, the latest executive entrusted with molding one of the worst teams in professional sports into winners.

"We're really changing our focus toward winning," Bryan Colangelo said. "That's something that's a shift in culture."

That's a seismic shift in attitude for an organization that deliberately self-destructed its way toward the bottom of the standings.

Bryan Colangelo takes over days after Sam Hinkie quit as general manager via a rambling 13-page manifesto to ownership. The Sixers also announced Sunday that his father, Jerry Colangelo, has relinquished his role as chairman of basketball operations and will remain as special adviser to ownership.

Bryan Colangelo was previously president and general manager of the Toronto Raptors from 2006-13. One of three men to win NBA executive of the year with two different franchises, Colangelo also spent 15 seasons working for the Phoenix Suns.

Colangelo's teams have appeared in the NBA playoffs 11 times and won four division championships in his 18 seasons as a general manager.

The Sixers entered Sunday with the worst record in the NBA at 10-69 and last made the playoffs in 2012. They haven't won a championship since 1983.

Hinkie was always vague about when the Sixers might become winners again, often implying he would tank for years until he finally found his franchise player.

Scratch what Hinkie dubbed, "The Process." Bryan Colangelo has "The Plan."

"I've outlined for ownership what I think is realistic," Colangelo said.

Instead of answering to his dad, he'll report straight to Harris and the rest of the ownership group.

Harris said Jerry Colangelo recused himself from Philadelphia's front office search and that other candidates were considered for the position.

"I went with Bryan because he was the best guy for the job," Harris said.

Bryan Colangelo and Harris both expressed disappointment that Hinkie would not stick around and continue to help rebuild the team.

"This is not about a departure from a process," Colangelo said. "This is a moving forward with everything that's already been established."

So why take the job?

For all his faults, Hinkie left some talent and gobs of salary-cap room for the Sixers to play with this summer.

Coach Brett Brown seems set to return for a fourth season. Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, Jahlil Okafor and overseas prospect Dario Saric still have potential on the court or as trade bait. The Sixers have in the neighborhood of $60 million in cap space, and they could have up to four first-round picks in the 2016 draft. There's a state-of-the-art practice facility set to open in the fall in New Jersey.

It's not the Warriors.

But it's not where they were stuck in October, either.

Bottom line, Hinkie did exactly what he told Harris he would - strip the team of talent, dump veteran contracts, gobble draft picks and surrender all hope of winning now in exchange for building a contender years down the line.

"I do think it's been a success," Colangelo said. "We're at a jumping off point now where the organization is poised to take a major leap forward because of what's transpired over this last few years of what I'm going to call, a measured rebuilding process."

Hinkie, though, was a difficult person to know, and he failed to develop the kind of necessary personal connections with players, agents, fans and the media that allowed them to give him more rope for this elongated rebuild.

"This is a relationship business," Colangelo said. "And we're going to have to work on those relationships in a big way."

Stuck at 1-30 this season, Harris made the move to bring in Jerry Colangelo in December to oversee basketball operations. Harris and Jerry Colangelo then wanted to add more veteran basketball leadership to the front office - make it a more collaborative effort than just the analytics-minded Hinkie.

Hinkie did not share in Philadelphia's vision of having him adjust or add to the power structure, so he quit. Harris refused to say how Hinkie would have fit in the new regime had he stayed to work under or with Colangelo.

Hinkie informed the team via a 13-page resignation letter littered with references to Abraham Lincoln and flightless birds that he was out.

"It was an unorthodox way of resigning," Harris said.
f23a9d54-47be-4e83-8e86-5e58f39f81c2  — San Antonio star Tim Duncan was held out for the Spurs' game against Golden State on Sunday night.

Duncan, who turns 40 on April 25, rested after playing back-to-back games. He had four points in 19 minutes in a 112-101 loss to the Warriors on Thursday and 21 points in 35 minutes in Friday's 102-98 loss at Denver.

The Spurs were trying to stay undefeated at home. The Warriors were looking to match the NBA record for most victories in a season.

Golden State had lost 33 in a row in San Antonio dating to February 1997.

San Antonio also was without Boris Diaw, who has a sore muscle on his right side. Coach Gregg Popovich said David West would start with Diaw and Duncan out.

The Warriors rested Leandro Barbosa, but coach Steve Kerr said the rest of the roster is available.

Golden State was seeking its 72nd victory, which would tie the record set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96.
e893ee45-6c49-4b4d-996a-8b2b754502d5  — Philadelphia 76ers Managing General Partner Josh Harris announced today that the team has named Bryan Colangelo as President of Basketball Operations.

Colangelo most recently served as President and General Manager of the Toronto Raptors from 2006 to 2013. In his first full season at the helm of the Raptors (2006-07), the team saw a 20-win improvement from the previous year and tied a then franchise-high with 47 wins. Colangelo was named 2007 NBA Executive of the Year.

One of only three executives to win the award with two different franchises, Colangelo was also named NBA Executive of the Year in 2005 with the Phoenix Suns. After Colangelo's offseason acquisition of point guard Steve Nash, who would go on to win back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player awards in 2005 and 2006, the Suns notched a 62-20 regular season record and an appearance in the Western Conference Finals.

During his tenure with Toronto, Colangelo drafted current Raptors DeMar DeRozan (ninth overall, 2009), Jonas Valanciunas (fifth overall, 2011) and Terrence Ross (eighth overall, 2012). During the 2012 offseason, Colangelo dealt for point guard Kyle Lowry, who would be named an NBA All-Star in 2015 and 2016.

Over the span of 15 years with the Suns organization, Colangelo drafted NBA All-Stars Michael Finley (21st overall, 1995), Steve Nash (15th overall, 1996), Shawn Marion (ninth overall, 1999) and Amar'e Stoudemire (ninth overall, 2002).

All told, his teams have appeared in the NBA Playoffs 11 times and have captured four division championships in his 18 seasons as a general manager.

As part of the transition, Jerry Colangelo will relinquish the role of Chairman of Basketball Operations and remains as a special advisor to Harris.
1c5b0580-2dd7-4317-bd8a-b9987e9b82c1  — The Chicago Bulls finished 7-1 against the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. They outplayed the Cleveland Cavaliers in the fourth quarter and beat the defending conference champs in a playoffs-like atmosphere at United Center on Saturday.

And yet, after the final two games on their regular season schedule, the Bulls are headed home. To lick wounds, to mine what positives they can from their wildly mediocre and extremely unreliable 2015-16, to press their noses occasionally against the glass of the postseason party to which they uninvited themselves and to spin. Always to spin.

What Bulls fans will get when it's all officially over, after the Philadelphia 76ers drape black crepe Wednesday over another lost season, will be more eulogy than autopsy. "Injuries" will be mentioned a lot and, while they existed and nagged, there's been nothing like the Derrick Rose blowouts around which Chicago navigated nonetheless to the three most recent of the franchise's seven consecutive playoff appearances.

There will be talk about new coach Fred Hoiberg's challenge in fitting a touted pace-and-space offensive style to a group of players more familiar and comfortable with predecessor Tom Thibodeau's bark-and-park halfcourt game.

And fans who keep showing up at United Center 22,000 strong, thereby providing no tangible urgency for change, will hear about an offseason devoted to every last button, pulley and lever, about Bulls management being committed to using every apparatus available -- draft, trades, free agency -- to restore Chicago to playoff respectability.

It might even match in sincerity and staying power the justifications belched up a year ago for paying Thibodeau and his .647 winning percentage as much as $9 million to go away.

So no, the eulogies aren't going to offer much in the way of explanation for what went wrong for the Bulls this season, literally from the get-go of Rose's "I'll be a free agent looking for another pay day in July 2017" Media Day comments in September 2015. For that, you needed to have been paying attention over the past week or so, as Hoiberg, Jimmy Butler, veteran Pau Gasol and a few others dissected the team's failings while it still was a few blips shy of flatlining.

They definitely step up their game when they see me. – LeBron James

Gasol rattled off three of Chicago's most galling failings earlier Saturday, citing "a lack of sense of urgency," "a lack of awareness" and "a lack of maturity" in the locker room.

"There's been times where we dropped games, lost games, that we should never have lost, especially at home against certain teams," the 35-year-old center said. "Those are the times that guys don't realize how big of a price that you can pay at the end of the year and how much of a different position you're going to be [in] by those games in November, December, January. 'Ah, there's still 40 games to play, there's still 50 games to play.' No, those games are just as meaningful as the ones we've been playing for the last week or two where our life has been on the line."

Gasol, whose defensive lapses are as gaping as any of the Bulls, does an admirable job of laying out the what of things gone wrong for the Bulls. What he does not or cannot explain is the how of those nasties infiltrating what was brought back as an experienced, allegedly savvy intact roster from last season.

Was there no one to nip it all in the bud early? No voice that could rise above the rest and command his Bulls teammates to plant their sneakers and say no to that noise? Well, Gasol and Rose don't have the personalities or the volume in their voices. Joakim Noah, he of the awkward game but fiery heart, was hurt and marginalized.

As for Butler, he grabbed too directly at the team's leadership reins, generating more eye-rolls than followers. By last week, the self-made All-Star was dropping third-person references to "Jimmy Butler," still the only Bulls player he really could call out.

Butler did call out Hoiberg early, after a desultory loss to the Knicks in Madison Square Garden on Dec. 19, saying the first-year NBA head coach needed to "coach harder" in holding players accountable. There are those who think Hoiberg's immediate response should have been to sit Butler out of Chicago's next game, a loss to Brooklyn, to make his authority known up-close and personal. But he did not. Chicago got a nice 7-1 bump (including six playoff-bound opponents) to reach 22-12 on Jan 7, then began its slide back to blah.

Butler's challenge persists, in its candor and its perspective, as the defining moment of Hoiberg's first season. It was brought up again, four months after the fact, in pregame questioning Saturday: So, will you be louder and more direct next season?

Jimmy Butler: Should Bulls Trade Him? Rumors are that the Bulls will explore trading Jimmy this offseason, but should they?

"When I go back and look at the different segments of the season," Hoiberg said, "we got off to a pretty solid start with this thing. Then some things happened. I think most of that comes from the one comment that was made after the New York game by Jimmy. We had some pretty heated moments with our group, in the locker room, the in-film session. Would I change it and be more vocal, more direct? Maybe. Again, we'll evaluate that as we go into the offseason."

Add it to the list, already a long one. Gasol almost certainly is gone, the early-out in his contract offering him at a chance, as he turns 36, to land with a legitimate contender for some late-career fun. General manager Gar Forman's comments about Gasol as a building block for the Bulls -- at a price significantly higher than his current $7.7 million -- rang hollow as soon as he said it in February, offered more to stifle chatter about next season than to lay out a real blueprint.

Noah might or might not be back, his game less valuable to the Bulls than his presence. Rose and Butler claim they'll work out together this offseason to improve their chemistry and communication, though it's easy to imagine a summer stalemate in which the former in L.A. and the latter in San Diego each expects the other to make the I-5 drive.

VP John Paxson and Forman are safe because that's the way newly enshrined Hall of Famer, Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, rolls with his executives. And Hoiberg has the dual job security of being Forman's choice as coach even before the position was vacant and of having four years and $20 million left on his deal. It wasn't Hoiberg's fault he was undercut well before his arrival, by management telling the locker room "Aw, don't worry what the coach wants" all of last season.

The Bulls' championship ambitions, for this bunch at least, are ending with more whimper than bang. LeBron James, who normally puts them down each spring, instead gave them a pat on their heads and a sideways shot on his way out of town Saturday, heading to far better things.

"The Chicago Bulls team that plays us is not going to be the one that's struggling a little bit off and on, as of late," James said. "They always play well versus us. It's like human nature -- when they see me, it's like 'OK.' They wish I wore every uniform at this point. They definitely step up their game when they see me."

Except that the struggle hasn't been a little bit, merely off and on, or just of late. It got addressed in this space quite a while back, both here and here.

What it has been is an embarrasingly blown opportunity in which Rose has played in 66 games, Gasol at 35 has put up 46 more double-doubles and Butler again reached All-Star status. The defense drooped, the offense never got traction, and rosy talk in training camp about Doug McDermott, Tony Snell and Bobby Portis has given way to rosy talk on the brink of elimination about Cristiano Felicio, Justin Holiday and E'Twaun Moore.

But hey, the Bulls are 7-1 against the best in the East and 11-5 against the top six teams in the NBA this season. You can do the math for how they've done against everybody else, those more of their ilk.

d3c7999e-9c96-40f2-b253-f2dec49f5006  — Farewell to Sleep Train Arena and the crowd noise and the leaky roof that caused a rain delay during an indoor basketball game and the small closet that visiting teams opened to learn it was actually their locker room and the cowbells and the college-fieldhouse feel and the previous final game and the other names.

Farewell to the last of its kind.

The NBA's old barns are officially all gone now, gyms replaced by massive structures with roofs that bump against the clouds, homey joints lost to time and the necessity of greater revenue through luxury suites. The Kings played in Sleep Train for the final time on a nostalgic Saturday night, and the entire league turned a page.

It was some wake. Dozens of former players, coaches and executives were brought back for the goodbye game, a 114-112 victory over the Thunder, before the 32-48 Kings close another embarrassing season at Phoenix and Houston. The two greatest players of the Sacramento era, Chris Webber and Mitch Richmond, did not show, and the popular Jason Williams skipped as well, but the list of attendees was long and impressive: Mike Bibby, Spud Webb, Doug Christie, Reggie Theus, Vinny Del Negro, Kenny Smith, Brian Grant, Scot Pollard, Geoff Petrie, Rick Adelman, Peja Stojakovic and Vlade Divac and many others.

In a classy move by the franchise, Danielle Tisdale represented her late father Wayman, the joyful, soulful Tiz who should never be forgotten, on this or any other night. She was showered with applause. Adelman received what was probably the loudest ovation as every former King and Sacramento Monarch, the defunct WNBA team, in attendance was introduced at halftime. Former assistant coach Pete Carril, now 85, a Hall of Famer from his time as the Princeton head coach, shuffled back into the spotlight.

All the other old-school arenas had disappeared from the NBA landscape long ago, replaced by structures, some still loaded with charm and some just big, antiseptic and too often without personality beyond the enormity. Not that it was ever meant to be this way. Arco Arena, as it is best known, before becoming Power Balance Pavilion, before becoming Sleep Train Arena, was the last one standing not by choice, but because past generations of local leaders kept finding ways to bungle attempts for a replacement building.

The inability to close a deal nearly cost the city its only major league franchise in 2013, when the Kings' owners, the Maloof family, sold to a group that would have moved the team to Seattle. The Earth started to shake in ways that could have changed NBA history: There is a good chance Phil Jackson would have become head of basketball operations for the new SuperSonics and that his first major act, a new coach, would have been hiring ... Steve Kerr.

Thunder vs. Kings Rudy Gay scores 24 points for the Kings, who celebrated the final game at Sleep Train Arena with a 114-112 victory over the Thunder.

The final night of that season, 2012-13, fans milled around after the game under the heavy gloom of uncertainty. Maybe they could be part of greatest fourth-quarter comeback in basketball history and convince the league the Kings should stay, but there was every reason to be nervous as the crowd stayed long after the final buzzer, some in the stands and many on the court with the approval of management. The Board of Governors had never turned down a decision from a fellow owner to sell without a problem with finances or the background check, and there definitely was none of that with the Seattle group or market.

The Kings would have been gone long before if commissioner David Stern had not laid himself on the tracks, and it was Stern who saved the city again in 2013. He counseled Mayor Kevin Johnson, the former All-Star point guard, on finding a new owner and, most importantly, an arena deal. Another power broker, Jerry Colangelo, the former Suns owner during KJ's years in Phoenix and essentially an extension of Stern, likewise went over the playbook with Johnson.

Johnson got the new ownership group, headed by Vivek Ranadive, and the new arena. The Board of Governors kept the team in Sacramento.

The resulting Golden 1 Center eight miles down Interstate 5 from Sleep Train is scheduled to open with concerts in late-summer and be ready for the start of the Kings exhibition schedule in October. It is part of the move toward massive -- it will be nearly twice the size of the old place even with about the same seating capacity, and the overhead videoboard will stretch baseline to baseline in what the team says will be the largest in the world for an indoor arena. There will be five hangar doors that will open at one end when the weather is nice, maybe even during games, depending how trial runs go in preseason and with the high school and college contests that will be played there.

The roof is going to be so much higher that fans can make the same amount of noise as in Sleep Train and it won't rattle eardrums like before. The days of games being played in a cauldron over a high flame, as in the 2002 Western Conference finals against the Lakers as emotions ricocheted everywhere, or just with the old wall of sound crashing down are gone.

But the NCAA tournament is coming back to Sacramento in March. Saturday against the Thunder was about the memories in the old gym, but the start of 2016-17 will be about the new beginning with invitations extended to Stern and Adam Silver. The Kings are hoping to bid to host the 2019 All-Star game, even while realistic they aren't close to the number of hotel rooms that would be required, making it a long-shot attempt and prompting the consideration of every idea from having some visitors stay in the Wine Country some 60 miles to the southwest or bringing cruise ships up the Sacramento River.

The fans milled around long after the final home game, the real final home game this time, with approximately 3,000 people still in the stands and on the court about an hour after the buzzer, allowed to shoot and hang out. The mood Saturday was anything but 2013, and for good measure the team brought out carts loaded with boxes of sparkling apple cider and plastic cups for the 500 or so still around two hours after the buzzer. This was a celebration of what comes next in the fall, because the surreal is actually happening after about a dozen years of talk and disappointment, and also a farewell to a friend. A farewell to the last of its kind.

Hornets vs. Wizards (Noon ET, NBA TV)

Tight East Race

NBA TV's tripleheader coverage kicks off at noon ET with a critical Eastern Conference matchup. The Hornets enter today's action in the No. 6 seed, tied record-wise with No. 5 seed Miami, 1.0 game behind No. 4 seed Boston and 1.5 games behind No. 3 seed Atlanta. All three spots are in reach for Charlotte with three games left and you know they would love to move into the No. 3 or 4 seeds to secure home-court advantage in the first round. The Hornets are 2-1 against the Wizards this season, even though offensive leaders Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum have each shot below 41 percent during all three games. Charlotte will need much more from Walker and Batum tonight against a Wizards team looking to play spoiler. Speaking of that ...

Washington Spoiler

The Wizards were officially eliminated from playoff contention last week after a disappointing, injury-filled season. John Wall did all he could to power Washington, but injuries continually disrupted the Wizards chemistry and made it difficult for the team to find a rhythm. Wall has missed the Wizards' last two games with a sore right knee and he could be sidelined again tonight. That would open the door for Bradley Beal, who has stepped up in Wall's absence to average 25.0 points on 56.8 percent from the field and 45.5 percent from 3-point over the last two games. Expect Beal and the Wizards to be extremely motivated tonight as they look to create havoc in the middle of the Eastern Conference playoff picture (they also host No. 3 seed Atlanta on the final night of the season).

Mavericks vs. Clippers (3:30 ET, NBA TV)

Win And Your In

The Mavericks can officially punch their ticket to the postseason with a win over the Clippers on NBA TV this afternoon. It would be the third straight playoff appearance for Dallas and 15th over its last 16 seasons. They currently sit in the No. 7 seed out West, 2.0 games ahead of No. 8 seed Utah, 0.5 games behind No. 6 seed Memphis and 1.5 games back of No. 5 seed Portland. The Mavericks have fought through injuries all season and will have to again tonight after guard J.J. Barea suffered a right groin strain the Mavericks win over Memphis on Friday night. Barea had been on fire before the injury, averaging 22.3 points on 52.9 percent shooting and 6.3 assists over his previous seven games. With Barea likely out, future Hall of Famer Dirk Nowitzki will fall back into his familiar role of offensive leader for Dallas. Nowitzki is averaging 23.0 points on 54.2 percent shooting and 8.0 rebounds over three games against the Clippers this season (1-2 record).

Ready For The Postseason

The Clippers locked up the No. 4 seed in the West last week, which has given coach Doc Rivers an opportunity to rest some of his key contributors. Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and J.J. Redick all sat out against the Jazz on Friday. But the Clippers were still able to pull off the win as veteran Jamal Crawford stepped up to score 30 and power Los Angeles past Utah in overtime. Expect coach Rivers to deploy a similar rest strategy against the Mavericks tonight, and expect Crawford to come out shooting again. There are few players as exciting as Crawford when he finds his rhythm, even at the ripe age of 36.

Warriors vs. Spurs (7 ET, NBA TV)

Inside Access: San Antonio Spurs vs. Golden State Warriors A behind the scenes look as the Golden State Warriors got their 70th win of the season, making them the second team in NBA history to do so, with a 112-101 defeat of the San Antonio Spurs

Chase For 73

Regular season games don't get much bigger than this. The Warriors, 71-9, must win tonight in San Antonio to keep their chase for an NBA-record 73 wins alive. The Warriors kept the record in play on Saturday in Memphis with their closest win of the season, 100-99. The Warriors are 17-2 on the second night of a back-to-back set, with the two losses coming in Milwaukee on Dec. 12 and in San Antonio on Mar. 19. In fact, the Warriors have lost 33 straight regular season games in San Antonio with their last win coming on February 14, 1997. They will look to snap that streak with a win tonight, which would tie them with the iconic 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for most wins in NBA history and set the record for most road wins in a season (34).

Perfect At Home

The Spurs have their own record in play as they look to become the first team in NBA history to go 41-0 at home during the regular season. The Spurs are currently 39-0 in San Antonio with an average margin of victory of 14.7 points. The home team has won every game during the Spurs vs. Warriors season series, so San Antonio has the upper hand tonight. A loss would mark a third straight defeat for San Antonio, which is unprecedented for them this season. They lost a second straight for the first time on Friday when they fell to the Denver Nuggets, 102-98.

Two Of The Best

It's sometimes easy to forget how dominant the Warriors and Spurs have been this season amid all the hoopla and storylines that have surrounded them. San Antonio currently has the fifth best point different in NBA history (+11.0 points per game) while Golden State has the seventh best (10.69). They have the top two records in the league, two of the top three offensive ratings (Warriors are first, Spurs third) and two of the top five defenses (Spurs are first, Warriors fifth). They play different styles and at different paces, but when it comes down to it they both win. And they will both look to continue that winning tonight as they hope to keep their historic quests alive and make a statement before the playoffs start next week. You won't want to miss it!

NBA.com staff reports
ce680470-9d0f-4f4c-ab3e-b2db3180d351  — Karl-Anthony Towns climbed into his car after an August workout, less than six weeks before starting his first NBA training camp. As he started driving, an alert buzzed on his phone announcing the death of Darryl Dawkins.

The one-time backboard-breaking center was known as Chocolate Thunder or Dr. Dunkenstein during his days with the Philadelphia 76ers. Towns knew him as Uncle Darryl.

Dawkins and Towns' father, Karl, were friends for 20 years. So Karl-Anthony spent countless Sundays attending barbecues at Dawkins' home, with the loquacious former player helping the kid develop his game and goofy sense of humor. Now he was gone at 58.

"He called me from his car and said, `Dad, yes or no,"' Karl Towns said. "I said, `Karl, Uncle Darryl just passed away."'

"I almost crashed the car," Karl-Anthony Towns recalled. "I had no idea. I called my dad and he was like, `Yeah, I got a call this morning about it."'

It was the first of two crushing losses for Towns in the months leading to his rookie season. Just days before the season started, Flip Saunders, the Minnesota Timberwolves president and coach who picked Towns No. 1 overall in the June draft, died after a brief battle with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Before Towns embarked on one of the best rookie seasons the NBA has seen in decades, before he could team with Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and Ricky Rubio to restore hope and faith in a franchise that has been bereft of both for a dozen years, he was a 19-year-old trying to balance the excitement of realizing a lifelong dream with the despair of losing two men who loomed so large in his development as a basketball player.

"To lose a person who has mostly been with me as I've been playing and teaching me little things here and there in my uncle Darryl, and to lose the person who gave me my NBA dream in Flip, it was hard," Karl-Anthony Towns said. "But they both contributed to the way I've played this year. They've been able to help me even not being on this Earth anymore."

Maybe he always would have been this good. Maybe it was his destiny to emerge as the prototype for the modern NBA big man - a versatile, two-way dynamo that can shoot the 3, run the floor, protect the paint and switch onto point guards in the pick-and-roll to force wild shots from the perimeter.

I'm like an addict. I've got an addiction to this game. An addiction to being perfect. – Karl-Anthony Towns

But the motivation of carrying on the legacy of Uncle Darryl while validating the faith that Flip showed in choosing the Kentucky center over several other high-profile options only added fuel to his quest for the perfect game.

"You lose somebody you really cared about who you consider family and then you lose another one, it was pretty hard on a 19-year-old kid," Karl Towns said. "But he dealt with it. He dedicated the season to two people he really idolized and respected."

Towns has put together the best rookie season in some time. His season averages of 18.2 points, 10.5 rebounds and 1.7 blocks haven't been achieved by a rookie since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993. His Player Efficiency Rating of 22.4 would be the highest for a rookie since Tim Duncan in 1997-98, and he's turned the Rookie of the Year competition into a coronation.

And it doesn't stop there.

Towns is also making a case for All-NBA consideration. Only Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan have grabbed more rebounds than Towns this season. He ranks sixth in blocks (133), eighth in field-goal percentage (.540) and enters the game at Portland on Saturday night with 14 straight double-doubles, the longest streak in the NBA this season.

"He's going to be a Hall of Famer in this league," Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant said.

And yet for Towns, this has been nowhere near enough. The Timberwolves have won just 27 games, a big step forward from the 16 they won last year but still far outside the playoff race. His individual season has earned him gushing praise that he has no interest in accepting.

After each game, he focuses on the shot that didn't fall, the rebound that was just out of his grasp, the defensive rotation he was late on that led to an open layup.

Inside Stuff: Towns and Porzingis at All-Star weekend Inside Stuff goes behind the scenes with Karl-Anthony Towns and Kristaps Porzingis as the rookies experience their first All-Star Weekend.

"I've never felt like I've had a good game," Karl-Anthony Towns said. "It's hard to get me to even say I played good. That's just in me. I'm just never satisfied.

"A lot of my friends get annoyed by it. I'm never happy about anything, playing-wise. I always think there's things I messed up on, things I should've done differently that could've made us win or made the win easier."

The perceived shortcomings are discussed at length in late-night telephone conversations between father and son. And every once in a while the star center will mention a promise he made to Saunders that he would end Minnesota's 12-year playoff drought.

"I'm in the search for the perfect game," Karl-Anthony said. "I'm like an addict. I've got an addiction to this game. An addiction to being perfect."

If there are dangers in setting the bar so high, the Towns family doesn't see them.

"He'll never say he played a great game until they make the playoffs," Karl Towns said. "He'll never say he played a perfect game until they win the championship."

Despite his superb first season, which has included being named Western Conference rookie of the month in all five months, there have been days where the title, the perfect game, even the playoffs seem light years away. On those days, Karl-Anthony will go to his phone and pull up a long text message he got from Saunders in July.

It's a blueprint for success in the NBA that Saunders sent him a couple months after he was diagnosed with lymphoma.

"I almost got it memorized in my head," he said. "It's something that keeps me going and lets me know that I'm doing right, that I'm making this dream a reality. I'm just trying every day to make sure that I let people know the last decision he made for this organization was his best one."
e7a74331-95fa-4922-8b6e-c40e401520e0  — Golden State coach Steve Kerr says he is holding Australian center Andrew Bogut out of the game with Memphis on Saturday for some rest before playing at San Antonio on Sunday as the Warriors chase the NBA single-season wins record.

Kerr said after the shootaround he just didn't want Bogut to play both games with everyone else available. Bogut has started 64 of 68 games this season, averaging 20.7 minutes.

The coach says any player who is banged up should tell him, and Kerr also wants to limit minutes played against Memphis.

Kerr says the Warriors will try to win the game but not at the expense of wearing people out.

The Warriors (70-9) have three games left to pass the 72-10 record of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls.
5e632e62-a2c4-44b3-a3fe-d3fbe74faf5d  In the end, it was a four-game stretch that decided things in the inaugural OSPR.

One guy came strong while the other opened the week nicely before taking his foot off the gas. To be king of the mountain, you've got to sprint through the finish line.

Meanwhile, a legend ready to walk off into the sunset turns in what may be his last 30-point game to keep a spot on the list. Also, a big man in the desert has a scorching week to close 2015-16 in nice position.

Notes: Statistics are through games of April 7. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings



1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 2 | Week 1 rank: 2

Last week's stats: 4 games, 17.5 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 3.8 apg

Season stats: 16.6 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 4.1 apg

It was a forgettable week for the Bulls (1-3), but not for Gasol. The Spaniard pocketed three double-doubles while shooting 51.9 from the field. He also managed 3.5 blocks, getting four blocks in three of four games. This comes after a stretch of eight games where Gasol went for more than two blocks just twice. And as we see below, he's still up to his old tricks.

Assist of the Night: Pau Gasol Pau Gasol works the give-and-go with Nikola Mirotic with the over the head pass to the cutting Mirotic for the easy bucket.

2. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 1 | Week 1 rank: 1

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.7 apg

Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 1.7 apg

After starting the week with a 19-point effort against Detroit, Nowitzki basically pulled a no-show, combining for 20 points on 6-for-26 shooting over the next two games. For the week, Nowitzki shot just 31.8 from the field and a paltry 23.1 from beyond the arc, including an ugly 2-for-10 on Sunday. He also failed to snatch more than six rebounds in any game.

3. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 4 | Week 1 rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.3 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 4.7 apg

Season stats: 15.3 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 2.1 apg

How does Randolph move up a notch despite shooting just 40.4 from the field? By securing your first double-double (27 points, 10 rebounds on Tuesday) since March 21, a span of five games. It also helps when you score at least 15 points in your other two games. Despite nagging injuries, Randolph came on strong late, averaging 20.3 over his last seven games.

Randolph Drops 27 Zach Randolph scores 27 points with 10 boards to lead Memphis over Chicago.

4. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 3 | Week 1 rank: 3

Last week's stats: 2 games, 18.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 19.2 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.7 apg

After missing the first two games of the week with back and neck injuries, Wade delivered two games of 15-plus points. He also managed to shoot 50 percent from the field and added 1.5 steals. But it wasn't enough production to prevent Randolph from jumping ahead of him. Despite that, Wade still turned in a very productive season.

5. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 5 | Week 1 rank: 8

Last week's stats: 4 games, 13.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 4.5 apg

Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 4.0 apg

After a recent shooting slump, Johnson appears to have rediscovered his shot, managing 57.5 FG% and 41.7 3PT% -- though he never took more than 11 shots in any game last week. He's now gone for double-digit scoring five straight times after failing to eclipse that mark in four consecutive games.

6. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: Just missed | Week 1 rank: 10

Last week's stats: 4 games, 15.8 ppg, 14.0 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 7.1 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 1.0 apg

We gave serious thought to moving up Chandler into the top five. Why? Because he notched four double-doubles for the week to go along with 71.4 shooting. Chandler now has five straight double-doubles and has shot 50 percent or better in 28 straight games (hey, so what if some of those games were 1-for-2 or 2-for-4).

7. Matt Barnes (36), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 8 | Week 1 rank: NA

Last week's stats: 3 games, 14.0 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 9.9 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.1 apg

Let's get the ugly out of the way early. Barnes started the week Friday 1-for-7 for two points before registering two solid performances, highlighted by Sunday's 24-point effort against the Magic in which he nailed five 3-pointers. That was his highest scoring output since going for 26 points on March 11 against the Pelicans.

8. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 9 | Week 1 rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 0.7 apg

Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 2.8 apg

The shooting was horrific (32.2 FG% and 26.3 3PT%), much like it's been all season, but Bryant managed to ascend one spot on the strength of a 34-point effort against the Celtics on Sunday. It could turn out being the last 30-point game of his Hall of Fame career, so it's only fitting it came against longtime rival Boston.

Bryant Scores 34 Points Kobe Bryant scores 34 points and grabs four rebounds against the Celtics.

9. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 7 | Week 1 rank: 6

Last week's stats: 2 games, 11.5 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 3.5 apg

Season stats: 13.9 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.3 apg

Crawford was consistent last week in terms of his shooting: 44.4 FG%, 44.4 3PT%. But after a solid 19-point performance against the Wizards on Sunday, Crawford fell flat, managing just four points on 2-for-6 shooting in 18 minutes. He also failed to hit a 3-pointer for just the second time in his last 11 games.

10. Vince Carter (39), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: NA | Week 1 rank: NA

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.3 apg

Season stats: 6.5 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

Three double-digit scoring games on the strength of 50 percent shooting, and 41.7 from beyond the arc, gets Carter back on the list to finish the season. What was most impressive is that he averaged 13.3 points in just 22.7 minutes. He's also gone five straight games with at least one made 3-pointer.

70caa051-2ae4-4c0d-b09d-1fc9c0d755a9  — J.J. Barea, a key component in Dallas' push for the playoffs, strained his right groin and won't return to a game against Memphis.

Barea was injured midway through the first quarter Friday night when he was fouled on a drive by Jordan Farmar. He's the team's leading scorer during a five-game winning streak that pushed the Mavericks to seventh place in the Western Conference.

The diminutive sparkplug returned in the second quarter, but was slowed significantly and left for good about 3 minutes after coming back in.

Barea is starting because Deron Williams has missed eight straight games with a left abdominal strain. Raymond Felton is the most experienced point guard with the Mavericks in a race with Utah and Houston for the final two playoff spots in the West.
46fc2175-5a91-4337-aace-f4566dc45a7c  — San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich is resting every starter except Tim Duncan against the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.

Popovich will sit LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and Tony Parker. Manu Ginobili also will be on the bench, along with Boris Diaw, who's dealing with a sore right adductor.

The night off comes on the heels of a loss Thursday at Golden State. Duncan didn't play big minutes against the Warriors, so he will be out there because Popovich wants to "keep him in shape," he explained.

Popovich plans to go with his regular rotation Sunday when the Spurs host the Warriors. And while San Antonio has won 48 straight regular-season games at home dating to last season, Popovich says the streak is "absolutely meaningless" to him.

Asked why, he said: "What does that get you if you're defeated? Does it win you anything? That's why it's meaningless."
6a4d8483-aaf0-4401-8bae-32f81054c556  — The Phoenix Suns say guard Brandon Knight has undergone surgery to treat a sports hernia.

The team said in a news release that the surgery was performed Thursday in Philadelphia by Dr. William Meyers. The Suns said Knight has begun rehabilitation and is to return to Phoenix next week.

Injuries limited Knight to 52 games this season but he averaged a career-high 19.6 points for a Phoenix team that, at 21-58, has the third worst record in the NBA. The Suns have been without guard Eric Bledsoe since he underwent knee surgery in late December.
c5e11507-8ba9-45cb-bb12-f48672a9ccb3  — LeBron James spent a recent off day stacking pizza boxes and taking orders.

The Cavaliers star surprised customers at a Blaze Pizza store in Pasadena, California, by posing as a new employee named, "Ron." In a video released Friday , James walks behind the counter carrying pizza boxes before chatting with customers as they wait in line.

James recommends trying a spicy sauce to one customer, who does several double-takes while trying to figure out if he's talking to the NBA great. Another customer mistakes him for former Miami teammate Dwyane Wade. James says, "I get that a lot."

James filmed the spoof earlier this month while the Cavs were in Los Angeles playing the Clippers and Lakers. It's not the first time James has shown off his acting chops. He had a supporting role in last year's comedy, "Trainwreck," starring Amy Schumer.

The 31-year-old James is an investor in the Blaze Pizza franchise.
88eda359-e7ea-4576-a1ee-4ffd98126427  — This time it truly will be goodbye for the Sacramento Kings and their longtime arena.

After two previous possible farewells when the Kings were contemplating a move out of Sacramento, the team will play its final home game at the arena it has called home since 1988 on Saturday night against Oklahoma City.

Making this one far less emotional than the ones at the end of the 2011 and 2013 seasons is the fact that Kings are only moving to a fancy new downtown arena instead of out of California's capital city entirely.

But there will still likely be some tears and high emotions when the doors shut for the final time. The NBA's smallest arena was also once its loudest when sellout crowds came out nightly to cheer one of the league's most entertaining teams in the early 2000s.

"When you think old school, you think about the Boston Garden, Chicago Stadium, the Forum, arenas like that," said former Kings guard and current CSN California analyst Doug Christie. "It had its own character and charm. Obviously the new arena is absolutely awesome. But that was one special place."

The building formerly known as Arco Arena produced sellout streaks of 497 and 354 straight games and provided one of the most notorious home-court advantages in the league. Fans clanked cowbells so loud that opposing coaches and players pleaded to have the noisemakers banned.

The venue has changed names to Power Balance Pavilion and the current Sleep Train Arena, but the constant was the proximity of the fans to the court, creating an intimidating environment.

"The one thing that was different was it was not as big as the normal NBA arenas," former Kings guard Bobby Jackson said. "The fans were more hands on. You were able to converse and talk with them because they were close to the court. Then you had the cowbells, which were very distracting to the visitors and played a huge part in our success."

In a five-year span starting in 1999-2000, the Kings had the best home record in the league at 168-37. With unselfish teams led by Chris Webber, Mike Bibby, Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic, Sacramento was one of the best shows in the NBA.

The Kings made eight straight playoff trips starting in 1998-99, losing an overtime game at home in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals to the Lakers in 2002.

"That series against the Lakers it was so loud that you could barely hear anything on the court," Christie said. "One time I looked at the referee and said, `Is this awesome?' And he said it was incredible."

But outside of that long run of success under coach Rick Adelman, there was mostly failure. The Kings made just one other playoff trip at the arena and are wrapping up their 10th straight season without making the postseason.

Now the hope for the franchise is that the opening next season of the new downtown arena will help end the decade-long struggles.

"The memories created there will last forever," said Divac, now the team's general manager. "But as the door closes here a beautiful one opens at Golden 1 Center - one of the best arenas in the world."

The arena was far from universally loved, with its most vocal critic being former Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who called Sacramento a "cow town" and said Kings fans were "semi-civilized" and "maybe redneck in some form or fashion" during one of the three playoff series the teams played from 2000-02.

But one of the main antagonists in those series has fonder memories of the arena.

"This has always been a special place, not just for me, but for the city itself," Lakers star Kobe Bryant said after his final game there in January. "It's sad to see this place go. There is so much history here."

But it is time to leave. After the team was close to relocating in recent years, new owner Vivek Ranadive and Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson managed to get an arena built that would keep the Kings in Sacramento for years to come.

While those who spent many years at the old arena will miss it, they also welcome the change.

"What I love about this arena is it was built for basketball," said Kings announcer Jerry Reynolds, a former coach and player personnel director for the team. "It has great sight lines and is a great place for fans to watch the game. But it's time has come. It's time to move on."
2bf62cd7-581f-4be9-b7a1-c4ba9118d3cb  — If the Golden State Warriors are going to set the NBA single-season wins record, they will have to go through a full-strength San Antonio squad to do it.

Coach Gregg Popovich said he plans to play all his healthy players Thursday at Golden State and then again when the teams meet Sunday in San Antonio. The only injured player currently for San Antonio is key reserve Boris Diaw, who has a sore right abductor.

The Spurs frequently give their older players time off in the regular season to make sure they are healthy come playoff time. But Popovich also said it's important for them to play consecutive games, which is why he did not rest anyone Tuesday night in Utah or for the first game against the Warriors.

"You need to play a couple of games in a row," Popovich said. "You can't just sit them, play, sit them, play, sit them, play. That's too disjointed. That's why we played everybody at Utah and everybody tonight to get everyone into a rhythm."

Popovich said he will rest several players for the back-to-back Friday at Denver but expects to play his stars again Sunday.

"We don't want to sit them two games in a row going into the playoffs," he said. "It doesn't make much sense."

Golden State (69-9) needs to win its final four games to break Chicago's single-season wins record of 72 set in 1995-96. The Warriors also have games Saturday at Memphis and then again at home next Wednesday against the Grizzlies.
77f58f27-8a2e-4449-94d6-9c41bbf715b5  — Toronto Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll has returned from right knee surgery after missing 41 games.

Before getting hurt, Carroll averaged 11.7 and 4.8 rebounds in 23 games. Carroll, in the first season of a four-year, $60 million contract, entered the game in the second quarter.

Coach Dwane Casey said the Raptors want to "incorporate him in a little bit as we go in these last (five) games" of the regular season.

Toronto has secured no worse than the No. 2 playoff seed and began the night three games behind Cleveland in the Eastern Conference.

Carroll, a seventh-year veteran, had the best two seasons of his career playing for the Atlanta Hawks. Atlanta couldn't afford to keep him in free agency, choosing instead to re-sign All-Star forward Paul Millsap.
3433ab8d-4bd6-488d-a0ea-ab39c9e19636  — Kobe Bryant stands up, and hundreds rise with him. An urgent, wordless buzz steadily builds to an ovation while he heads to the scorers' table to enter the game.

If Bryant scores, the crowd roars with the memories of all the shots that came before.

And if another member of the Los Angeles Lakers intrudes on these special moments, he'll often hear something else.

"I feel bad for the other guys, because every time they shoot the ball, they get booed," Bryant said with a smile.

A similar scene has unfolded in arenas from Los Angeles to Boston ever since the third-leading scorer in NBA history announced his 20th season would be his last.

After claiming he didn't want a farewell tour when he retired, Bryant changed his mind in late November, turning the Lakers' season into a moveable tribute to a polarizing, globally respected athlete. Fans are relishing their final chances to watch Bryant's graceful game with the Lakers, who happen to be finishing up the worst season in franchise history.

The tour hits its final four stops in the next week. The Lakers have road games in New Orleans, Houston and Oklahoma City before Bryant's grand finale at home Wednesday against Utah.

"It's something that he deserves, that he's earned, and that we all want to do," said Lakers coach Byron Scott, Bryant's teammate in his rookie season. "I don't think anybody can question K.B.'s place in the game, and it's only natural that people want to honor him. We all do, too."

Kobe's long goodbye has led to some weird scenes, such as those boos for his teammates, or the time in Denver when an injured Bryant signed autographs and gave away his shoes while sitting on the bench.

He has been cheered in Sacramento, Detroit, Philadelphia and other cities that had greeted him with seething hatred for the better part of two decades. Celebrities and millionaires gather outside the Lakers' locker room each night, waiting for Bryant to finish chatting with opposing players angling for autographed shoes or jerseys.

"I can feel it, and it feels pretty damn awesome," Bryant said. "It makes going through the years of losing, and not leaving, makes it all worthwhile. Staying here and taking the good with the bad, and the fans embracing and understanding that, that we ride together, that's a love that you can't break, man."

Meanwhile, the Lakers are wrapping up a historically miserable three-year stretch. They've set the 16-time champion franchise's record for single-season losses in three consecutive years, culminating in Wednesday's 62nd defeat.

"It doesn't matter," Bryant said. "It's hard for people to understand this, but losing is losing, and there aren't different degrees of losing. You either win a championship, or you're in the same boat we're in. It's very black and white to me. So whether you set a franchise record for losses or you get to the playoffs and lose in the Western Conference finals, those are the same damn thing to me."

That's the view of an 18-time All-Star with five NBA championship rings. The youngsters and modestly accomplished veterans currently playing a fairly warped version of basketball don't have Bryant's perspective, and it's too soon to tell how their supporting role on Bryant's tour has affected rookie D'Angelo Russell or second-year pros Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle.

Russell succinctly summed up the Lakers' strategy lately: "Get Kobe the ball."

"Especially now that we're winding down, there is even more of a focus on K.B.'s last game," Scott said. "I think all that attention and all that focus is probably affecting (the younger Lakers) a little bit, because they see it just like everybody else. They want him to do well. They want to try to give him the ball as much as possible when he's on the floor. It's a lot to digest. I know the focus is sometimes not there, because there's so much stuff going on."

General manager Mitch Kupchak acknowledged months ago that Bryant's farewell is the Lakers' main priority this season, by practicality even more than preference. They can't really rebuild until they free up Bryant's playing time, ravenous shot selection and $25 million salary, highest in the NBA this season.

Bryant is 31st in the league in shot attempts (1,014) but 428th in field goal percentage (35.3), with the worst shooting accuracy of any player with at least 510 attempts.

But the Lakers know what the public wants, and what they owe to Bryant after two decades of service.

Bryant has been reflective and vocally grateful in recent weeks - and unlike his fans, the NBA's career leader in missed shots insists he doesn't care if he gets the ball every time.

"I will defer, and I'll just come out and play the game," Bryant said. "This is what I'm here for, one more time, is to just play the game."
3d2066c9-3a48-4f2f-a88d-809da8919373  With most Yahoo! Fantasy leagues completed and champions crowned, we look back at the top statistical performers this fantasy season:

*All statistics as of April 6*

Points - Stephen Curry

Stephen Curry's Top 10 Plays of 2015 The Chef was cooking this year, take a look back at Steph's Top 10 Plays of 2015.

Get ready to see a lot of Stephen Curry in this article. The reigning MVP stepped up his game to another stratosphere in 2015-16 with career highs in points, field-goal percentage, 3-point percentage, 3-pointers made, steals and rebounds. He's the only player in the league averaging 30 or more points, and he would be the first player to average 30-plus points for an entire season since Kevin Durant in 2013-14. He delivered three games of 50-plus points, 12 of 40-plus and 38 of 30-plus in 75 games so far this season. He scored less than 10 points only once and less than 20 just 12 times. And he did it all while shooting an absurd 50.2 percent from the field. It was an incredible regular season for the Warriors' star and if you had him on your fantasy team, points were rarely an issue.

Honorable mentions : James Harden (28.7 per game; 2,208 total), Kevin Durant (28.1; 1,964), LeBron James (25.0; 1,853)

Assists - Rajon Rondo

Rajon Rondo Notches 20 Assists Rajon Rondo records 20 assists in a losing effort against the Charlotte Hornets.

The veteran point guard bounced back in 2015-16 from a disappointing finish to last season in Dallas. Rondo is averaging a career-high 11.7 assists after struggling for just 7.9 in Boston and Dallas last year. He tallied two 20-assist games, 19 with 15-plus and hit nine assists in all but 16 games so far this season. His free-throw percentage (58 percent), low point totals (11.9) and turnovers (3.9) left a lot to be desired. But his high assist production was more than enough for fantasy owners who snagged Rondo in the late rounds (he was drafted on average with the 100th pick). In comparison, the three honorable mentions for assists (see below) were all drafted on average in the top 15 picks.

Honorable mentions : Russell Westbrook (10.4 per game; 810 total), John Wall (10.2; 789), Chris Paul (9.9; 706)

Rebounds - Andre Drummond

Nightly Notable: Andre Drummond Andre Drummond scores 25 points and grabs 29 rebounds versus the Pacers.

After four seasons in the league, it's easy to forget Andre Drummond is only 22 years old. The dominant center continued to improve in Detroit this season with a career-high 14.9 rebounds per game, including 4.9 off the offensive glass. He's grabbed 137 more rebounds than second place, DeAndre Jordan, and has a league-leading 66 double-doubles in 79 games. In fact, Drummond surpassed Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas (65 double-doubles) for the most double-doubles in a season in Detroit Pistons franchise history. Like Rondo, Drummond isn't devoid of flaws. He shot a career-low 35.5 percent from the free throw line on a career-high 7.3 attempts and blocked shots at a career-low rate of 1.4 per game. But the rebounds are why you draft Drummond, and boy did he deliver in 2015-16.

Honorable mentions : DeAndre Jordan (13.9 per game; 1,026 total), Hassan Whiteside (11.8; 804), Karl-Anthony Towns (10.5; 819)

Blocks - Hassan Whiteside

Whiteside's 10 Blocks Hassan Whiteside notches 10 blocked shots to power Miami over Charlotte.

The Block Party continued on for another season in Miami with Hassan Whiteside patrolling the paint at a league-best rate. Whiteside is averaging an incredible 3.8 blocks off the bench for Miami in 29.1 minutes a night. This mark is obviously a career high for the young Whiteside, and he will be the first player to average more than 3.5 blocks for an entire season since Serge Ibaka in 2011-12. Whiteside is averaging 1.5 blocks more than his next closest challenger, DeAndre Jordan, and has 81 more blocks than Jordan in seven less games. Whiteside was the only player in the league to block 10 or more shots in a game, and he did it three times. It was another dominant fantasy season for the 26-year-old Whiteside, who will hit the open market as an unrestricted free agent this summer.

Honorable mentions : DeAndre Jordan (2.3 per game; 170 total), Serge Ibaka (1.9; 145), Pau Gasol (2.0; 141)

Steals - Stephen Curry

Curry's Steal and Reverse Steph Curry gets the steal and makes the difficult reverse layup on the other end.

The lights-out shooter flashed his defensive skills throughout 2015-16 to average a career-high 2.2 steals. He tallied four or more steals in eight games and went without a steal only five times. Ricky Rubio, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook were all very close to Curry with an average of 2.1 steals. With 162 steals through 78 games, Curry sits only one steal behind the NBA high he set in 80 games during 2014-15. All signs point toward Curry eclipsing that mark during the Warriors' final four games of the season.

Honorable mentions : Russell Westbrook (2.1 per game; 161 total), Kyle Lowry (2.1; 153), Chris Paul (2.1; 149)

3-Point - Stephen Curry

Curry Hits 12 3-pointers Steph Curry tied an NBA record, hitting 12 3-pointers on Saturday night.

More Curry! The Warriors point guard is on track to break the NBA single-season 3-point record, which he set in 2012-13 and again in 2014-15, by more than 100 3-pointers this season. He has 382 entering Thursday's game against San Antonio and needs just four more to put him 100 3-pointers above his 2014-15 record of 286. He's shooting 45.6 percent from deep on 11.2 attempts per game and hit 10 or more 3-pointers in three games, including 12 against the Thunder in February to tie the NBA's single-game record. Curry's Splash Brother Klay Thompson is the only other player in the same realm as Curry, and he trails the reigning MVP by more than 100 3-pointers. The next closest player, Damian Lillard, trails by 160 3s. Curry was unstoppable all fantasy season and is the reason many fantasy owners will have a championship trophy on their mantle this summer.

Honorable mentions : Klay Thompson (3.5 per game; 266 total), Damian Lillard (3.1; 220), Kyle Lowry (2.7; 203)

459ceab5-8ed9-4371-b4d5-31b7a9cfdd64  — Gonzaga sophomore Domantas Sabonis will skip the rest of his college career and has declared for the NBA draft.

Sabonis, 19, said Thursday that he is exploring his future options without hiring an agent at this time.

The son of former NBA star Arvydas Sabonis, Domantas is Gonzaga's all-time leader in career field goal percentage at .632.

The 6-foot-11 forward was an honorable mention on AP's All-America list this season after averaging 17.6 points and 11.8 rebounds per game.

"This has been a very difficult decision for me because of the amazing two years I have had at Gonzaga," Sabonis said in a new release. "I want to thank the coaching staff, my teammates, and all of our great fans for making this such an incredible experience for me."

In just two seasons, he scored 1,002 points to become the 41st player in school history to score 1,000 points. He grabbed 694 rebounds.

"(Domantas) is as impressive of a person and player as I've ever coached," coach Mark Few said. "He has an insatiable desire to get better."

In his two seasons with Gonzaga, the Bulldogs advanced to the Elite Eight in 2015 and the round of 16 this season.

The Bulldogs leaned heavily on Sabonis after a season-ending back injury to center Przemek Karnowski, and the native of Lithuania responded with a huge season.

He averaged 19.7 points and 14.3 rebounds in Gonzaga's three games in this year's NCAA Tournament. It was the highest rebounding average of any player who appeared in at least two games.

Sabonis had 23 double-doubles this season and his 426 rebounds were the most by a Zags player since the program joined Division I in 1958.

Sabonis became the fifth Gonzaga player to leave school early, joining Paul Rogers (1997), Adam Morrison (2006), Austin Daye (2009) and Kelly Olynyk (2013). Morrison, Daye and Olynyk became first-round picks.

Gonzaga will also lose forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 20.4 points, to graduation. And it is unclear if the 7-foot-1 Karnowski will try to return to the Zags or pursue professional opportunities.

baa37724-5539-4d5b-a54d-289feaf618ee  The following is a statement on behalf of Philadelphia 76ers Managing General Partner Josh Harris:

"This evening, Sam Hinkie notified the organization that he has elected to step down as President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. While we are disappointed in Sam's decision, we would like to sincerely thank him for his contributions over the past three seasons. There is no question that Sam's work has put us in a very strong position to take advantage of numerous opportunities for an exciting future."
996f5957-59fa-4d1c-91a8-fa7cadb6f46e  — Hall of Famer Jerry Sloan said Wednesday that he has Parkinson's disease and a form of dementia.

The 74-year-old Sloan, who coached the Utah Jazz from 1988 to 2011, told The Salt Lake Tribune in an interview Wednesday that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia last fall.

He told the Tribune that he decided to go public about his illness because the Parkinson's symptoms have become noticeable. Symptoms include tremors and a hushed voice. Lewy body dementia is a neurological disorder whose symptoms include difficulty with memory and problem solving.

Sloan was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. He currently holds the title of senior basketball adviser with the Jazz and regularly attends games.

"Jerry Sloan is and always will be a beloved member of the Utah Jazz family, and we know he will approach this fight with the same grit and determination he displayed as a Hall of Fame coach and All-Star player in the NBA for 40-plus years," the Jazz said in a statement.

Sloan played 11 years in the NBA, including 10 with the Chicago Bulls. He was a two-time All-Star and was selected to the first-team all-defensive team four times and to the second team twice.

Sloan coached four years with the Bulls, the first as an assistant, after a knee injury forced him to retire in 1976. The Bulls retired his jersey in 1978.

He joined the Jazz as an assistant coach in 1985, moved to the lead spot in 1988 and held the head coaching position for 23 seasons. Sloan led the Jazz to the NBA Finals with Karl Malone and John Stockton in 1997 and 1998, but lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls both times.

He finished with the third-most wins in NBA history (1,221) and the sixth-best winning rate (60.3).

The Jazz had 13 50-win seasons under Sloan and 16 consecutive winning records. They reached the playoffs 20 times with Sloan.

"Now that Coach Sloan has shared the news on his health I will join the many others in expressing support," team president Steve Starks tweeted. "Simply put, a living legend!"
611bc81a-9e54-4dce-9be9-425465cf46bd  — The Philadelphia 76ers' front office has suddenly turned into the home of a Colangelo family reunion.

The NBA-worst Sixers are set to hire former NBA executive of the year Bryan Colangelo as their general manager, according to a person with knowledge of the hiring.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Colangelo's hiring was not official on Wednesday night.

He will work with his father, Jerry Colangelo, Philadelphia's chairman of basketball operations, to bring the forlorn franchise their first NBA championship since 1983.

Colangelo takes over in the wake of general manager Sam Hinkie's sudden resignation on Wednesday night, bolting the Sixers after he turned them into one of the worst organizations in NBA history.

Hinkie didn't even last three full seasons and left the Sixers with the worst record in the league at 10-68.

Team owner Josh Harris says he was disappointed in Hinkie's decision but that, "Sam's work has put us in a very strong position to take advantage of numerous opportunities for an exciting future."

The 76ers went 19-63 on his watch in his first season and 18-64 last season.

Hinkie ran an analytics-minded front office and stripped the organization of all major talent in the hope of bottoming out in the standings and acquiring lottery picks.

His power was weakened in December when the Sixers hired Colangelo to oversee basketball operations.

Under Hinkie and coach Brett Brown, the Sixers have been among the worst franchises in the league and show few signs of recovery in the next few years.

Hinkie was hired in 2013 after a stint as executive vice president of basketball operations for the Houston Rockets. He failed to lead the 76ers to their first NBA championship since 1983.

He made sweeping changes from the start, trading All-Star Jrue Holiday on his first draft night and later traded Michael Carter-Williams only a half season after he was the NBA rookie of the year.

Hinkie drafted or traded for injury-prone big men Nerlens Noel and Joel Embiid. Noel sat out a season and has not developed into the cornerstone player the Sixers hoped. Embiid was drafted with the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 draft and has to yet to play because of foot injuries.

Under Hinkie's watch over almost three seasons, the 76ers:

• lost 28 straight games stretching the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons.

• lost 26 straight games in the 2013-14 season.

• lost the first 17 games of the 2014-15 season.

• lost the first 18 games of the 2015-16 season.

Harris seemed to back Hinkie's approach - dubbed both "Trust The Process" by his defenders and "Tankadelphia" by critics - until the losses kept mounting in his third season. Even with rookie Jahlil Okafor playing well, the Sixers flirted with the worst record in NBA history; 9-73 set by the 1972-73 Sixers.

The 76ers beat New Orleans on Tuesday night, ensuring they would not tie their own league record for fewest victories in an 82-game season.

Embarrassed by the team's futility, the Sixers turned to Colangelo. Colangelo had a long career with the Phoenix Suns, serving as coach, CEO and general manager, among other roles. He was also on the NBA's board of governors.

He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004 as a contributor, considered one of the most influential owners in NBA history.

"What I see here is, there's a lot that needs to be done," Colangelo said on the day he was hired.

Hinkie doesn't exactly leave behind a barren cupboard - Noel, Embiid, Okafor and overseas prospect Dario Saric still have potential on the court or as trade bait, the Sixers are flush with cash in the salary cap and they could have up to four first-round picks in the 2016 draft.

"It's an exciting offseason and one we've long been looking forward to," Hinkie said at the trade deadline. "Obviously Joel's injury moved his timeline back from `15 to `16. That alone makes a big difference, not to mention the other picks we've acquired, the organic growth of the rest of our team. We think it'll be a big opportunity."

It's a future Hinkie will no longer help shape.

Following Hinkie's departure, the 76ers did not look far past the family tree for a replacement - Bryan Colangelo, had long been mentioned as having a future role in the organization after stints in Phoenix and Toronto.

He won the NBA's executive of the year after the 2006-07 season when the Raptors captured the Atlantic Division title and tied a franchise record with 47 wins. But he came under fire for the selection of Italian big man Andrea Bargnani with the No. 1 pick in the 2006 draft.

Colangelo joined the Raptors on Feb. 28, 2006, after 15 seasons with the Phoenix Suns. He was the Suns' GM for 11 seasons and also served as president in his last seven years there.

"Jerry Sloan is and always will be a beloved member of the Utah Jazz family, and we know he will approach this fight with the same grit and determination he displayed as a Hall of Fame coach and All-Star player in the NBA for 40-plus years.

f445113a-c44d-407b-b4fb-a95848a13461  — Wizards point guard John Wall has a sore right knee and will not play against Brooklyn on Wednesday night.

Wall has played in all 77 games this season for Washington, which enters Wednesday 3½ games out of the playoffs with five left to play.

The three-time All-Star is averaging a career-best 19.9 points and 10.2 assists in his sixth NBA season.
ae2078b2-7a2e-40fd-ba71-bb057976ec33  — Atlanta Hawks player Thabo Sefolosha filed a federal lawsuit against New York City on Wednesday, alleging he was unjustly arrested outside of a trendy nightclub last year during a fracas that left him with a broken leg and ended his NBA season.

The guard-forward had been arrested in April 2015 outside the 1Oak nightclub in Manhattan. Prosecutors had alleged he repeatedly disobeyed officers' orders to leave the area around the club where another NBA player, Chris Copeland, had been stabbed.

Sefolosha claims in his lawsuit that he called one of the officers "a midget" before he was thrown to the ground and arrested. He testified at his trial that he moved off the block at the behest of a confrontational officer and was trying to give a panhandler a $20 bill when he was grabbed by police and taken to the ground.

The officers "attacked and jumped" on Sefolosha and one used a baton to hit him during the arrest, he claims in the lawsuit. Sefolosha has said he was left with a broken leg during the struggle, causing him to miss the playoffs.

The Swiss national was acquitted in October of misdemeanor criminal charges.

His lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges the officers arrested him without cause and filed a false report. He is seeking unspecified damages from the city and five police officers.

Another player who was arrested during the fracas, Pero Antic, filed a lawsuit against the city and the police department last week, also alleging false arrest in relation to the fracas. Charges against him were dropped.

A spokesman for the city's law department said the office would review Sefolosha's allegations once it formally receives a copy of the suit.
090466c4-7094-41bb-a1a1-d40d22c0e546  — Cavaliers star LeBron James will sit out Wednesday night's game at Indiana to rest.

James, the four-time MVP and two-time champion, also sat out the final quarter of Tuesday night's blowout victory at Milwaukee and has playing some of his best basketball all season.

But coach Tyronn Lue said the Cavaliers track how many minutes each player logs and at this point in the season, any player in the "red zone" sits out. He said James is the only player currently under that restriction.

"It's the right game," Lue said during his pregame availability. "We're on a back-to-back and we want to be cautious with him."

James has averaged 27.1 points, 8.4 rebounds, 9.5 assists in his past eight games and is on pace for a record-breaking 12th consecutive season of averaging at least 25.0 points.

He also has been a thorn in the side of the Pacers, scoring at least 24 points in eight of the previous nine games against them.

The move also comes as the Cavs (56-22) are closing in on clinching the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the third time in franchise history. Cleveland entered Wednesday with a 3 1/2-game lead over Toronto with four games remaining on the Cavs schedule.

Toronto has five games left.

Could the absence hurt a team trying to build momentum heading into the postseason?

Lue said it won't.

Without James, though, the Cavs have struggled.

In the two seasons since he returned to Cleveland, the Cavs are just 4-13 without him.

Pacers coach Frank Vogel acknowledged his defensive game plan will change without James on the court, but that the Cavs still have enough "firepower" to win the game.

And Lue believes Cleveland has enough depth to pull off a win without James, against a team still fighting to get into the playoffs.

"I think our players are up for the challenge," Lue said. "We've been playing some great basketball."
8bf034e7-ee48-4ae2-bb6a-2c0eaad3dba0  — Ricky Rubio entered his fifth NBA season at a crossroads.

The Spanish point guard had carved a reputation as one of the best passers and defenders in the league, yet he still had so much to prove.

As he started a new four-year, $56 million extension, Rubio had to show that he could stay healthy and knock down the open jump shot.

As the Timberwolves head down the home stretch of a 12th straight season that will end without a playoff berth, Rubio has gone more than four months without missing a game and has started to see his shooting percentages climb as a result.

It's a relief not only to the Timberwolves and their fans, but to Rubio himself. He had a major knee injury as a rookie and a major ankle injury last year, both stunting his ability to work on his game in the summers.

And when he reported to training camp this season still experiencing some discomfort in his surgically repaired ankle, he started to wonder if he would ever be fully healthy.

"It's like damn, can my body handle it?" Rubio told The Associated Press. "I'm actually pretty happy how I handled the season. ... It's something I'm really proud of."

Play of the Day: Ricky Rubio Ricky Rubio's 3-pointer with :00.2 left seals Minnesota's 99-96 come-from-behind win over the Thunder.

He has not missed a game since Nov. 29, and is just five games away from his first summer without some sort of injury rehab since he came over from Spain in 2011. And he sees a direct correlation between his health and his improved shooting since the All-Star break.

A career 36 percent shooter, Rubio is shooting 42 percent in the past 24 games and 38 percent on 3-pointers. He is also shooting 51.3 percent at the rim this season, a dramatic improvement over the first four years (33.9).

"I think quietly Ricky has had an unbelievable year," coach Sam Mitchell said. "He's in the weight room, working on his body. He's been resilient. He's taken care of himself. I think Ricky likes playing with this core of young guys that we have. And he is included (in that young core). He's only 25."

He has worked with Arnie Kander, a renowned physical therapist, to strengthen his core and base and has flown in a trainer for Spain several times this season. He has also worked tirelessly with personal shooting coach Mike Penberthy and Wolves assistant Ryan Saunders to address his biggest weakness.

"This is the best I've felt," Rubio said of his shooting stroke. "The last (12) games I'm making one or two 3s a game. It's showing up. It's not just that. I'm not afraid to take the shot. Every time I take the shot, even when I miss, it feels like it's going in. It's a feeling that I've never had before."

Saunders has focused on simplifying the shooting process, dropping notes in Rubio's locker that emphasize being shot ready, shooting in one fluid motion, holding the follow-through and sticking the landing.

"One thing that I think is important to Ricky is to let him know you care and have confidence in him," Saunders said. "His mechanics have not been terrible or anything like that. He just needs confidence."

It's something Rubio has always yearned for -- the show of faith from the organization, especially after his name came up in February as the trade deadline approached. The Milwaukee Bucks made several overtures to Wolves GM Milt Newton, and the rumors stung Rubio.

Rubio said Newton told him that he was "almost traded, but we didn't because the other team didn't offer what we wanted."

"When the GM comes to you and says that's what happened, it hurts, but you've got to be professional," Rubio said. "You've been here all your career and thinking they were supporting you. At some point, they weren't. But I'm professional. I'm going to give it my all. I love playing basketball and every time I step on the court I want to win."

But Newton believes Rubio may have misinterpreted the conversation the two had after the trade deadline passed.

"I told him we've never, ever called another team to trade you, but it is my job to listen," Newton said. "I even shared that with his agent. I never told him we almost traded you, because we didn't almost trade him."

Newton said he would have further conversations with Rubio to clear up any misunderstanding. He called Rubio "extremely valuable to the organization" and said he has already run some possible roster moves by him to get his point guard's input.

"I know that he needs a little bit more communication," said Newton, who took over as the team's front office leader after Flip Saunders died in October. "If that's what it takes for a player to play to the best of his ability, those are things I'll have to realize and facilitate."

What Rubio wants most is stability. The roster changes in his five years have been dizzying, but now he sees a promising young core that includes Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine that he wants to grow with.

"I understand it's a business," Rubio said. "I really like playing with these guys. We have a chemistry. We're building it. And I'm having fun playing with them."
d3f46594-4b87-4b55-a3a8-2085f39eb36d  — Tony Ressler had one early objective when his ownership group bought the Atlanta Hawks last June.

"From the first day I toured our practice facilities, I felt that the Atlanta Hawks were and are at a professional disadvantage facilities-wise," Ressler said. "My view was that it was job No. 1 to change that. That was absolutely our first and highest objective."

The Hawks announced Tuesday they've partnered with Emory Healthcare to build a new practice facility and move team headquarters to a new campus a few miles north of Philips Arena before the 2017-18 season.

Other NBA teams, such as Minnesota, Cleveland and Chicago, have joined with regional healthcare companies on similar ventures in recent years, but Dr. Scott Boden, the director of Emory Orthopaedics and Spine Center, said this partnership is unprecedented.

"This goes much beyond sponsorship and naming rights," Boden told The Associated Press. "It's a much higher level of integration of two organizations in sports. The Hawks will have Emory's whole sports medicine division and entire orthopedic division not even two blocks away."

Peak Performance Project, a California-based center that tests and trains athletes, is onboard to join the project, too. The 90,000-square foot complex will be located in Brookhaven, about seven miles from Philips Arena.

"It's really something that doesn't exist in the NBA or really in almost any professional sport," Boden said. "And then when you add this will be the only other office for P3 beside Santa Barbara, we expect that this will be essentially the hub for professional athletes in all sports for the entire East Coast and Western Europe."

Hawks president and head coach Mike Budenholzer said the addition of P3 and its founder Dr. Marcus Elliott will give his team a competitive advantage.

"In our industry, they are so well respected," Budenholzer said. "Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Korver (and) every recent Hawks draft pick have all been sent to Santa Barbara to be tested so we could learn. We'll be able to do that in Atlanta."

Ressler, the principal owner of a group that paid $850 million for the Hawks and the rights to Philips Arena, now will turn his full attention to negotiating major upgrades to the arena, likely with public financial support.

Hawks and Emory officials said all funding for the new facility is private.

"We now have a plan to upgrade our player experience and we remain committed in trying to improve the fan experience in every way possible," Ressler told the AP. "We're trying our best to improve this arena and we don't necessarily have the ability to work on the same timeframe as quickly as this projected has moved forward."

The Hawks have practiced and trained inside Philips Arena since the building opened in the fall of 1999.

Ressler hopes the project will help the Hawks attract NBA free agents and retain star players like center Al Horford, whose contract expires this summer.

"We have a vibrant market, we have a really good coach and a really good team," Ressler said. "You have to have competitive facilities. We know will, no question."
67bb3c54-d5d7-45ca-b072-75a7c4bb19f6  — Celtics coach Brad Stevens says reserve forward Evan Turner is continuing to recover from a left eye abrasion and will sit out when they host the Pelicans on Wednesday.

Turner spent Tuesday at home resting and did not attend Boston's practice. He was hurt in the closing seconds of Boston's win over the Lakers on Sunday.

Turner had scored eight of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. He started in place of Avery Bradley, who was out for personal reasons.

Stevens said Turner would be day to day, but that he is hopeful he can return Friday when the Celtics host Milwaukee.

Boston will be trying to improve its playoff seeding during its final five regular-season games.
534c7fb9-d40d-4fb9-acc5-0f8923f20df6  — The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James and the Oklahoma City Thunder's Russell Westbrook today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Month, respectively, for games played in March.

James ranked second in the East in scoring (25.6 ppg) and fifth in assists (7.1 apg) as the Cavaliers went 11-5 for the month (10-4 with James in the lineup). He added 8.2 rebounds and shot 53.8 percent from the field. James was the only player in the NBA to average at least 25.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists in March. He posted seven double-doubles and recorded two triple-doubles. In a 107-87 win over the Brooklyn Nets on March 31, James scored 24 points to move into 12th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list (he is now 11th).

Westbrook led the Thunder to an 11-5 record behind averages of 21.7 points, 10.6 assists (third in the NBA) and 8.3 rebounds. His seven triple-doubles in March were the most in a calendar month since Michael Jordan had seven in April 1989. Those performances increased Westbrook's season total to 16 triple-doubles, the most since Magic Johnson had 17 in 1988-89. Westbrook scored at least 20 points in 11 of 16 games for the month and logged nine games with double-digit assists, including a career-high 19 in a 120-109 win over the Clippers on March 9.

7ef0cc90-ffdb-4c4b-9727-51aef2066ce9  — The Miami Heat's Josh Richardson and the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Rookies of the Month, respectively, for games played in March.

Richardson helped the Heat go 10-5 in March by ranking second among East rookies in scoring (12.0 ppg) and assists (2.1 apg), and leading the conference's first-year players in field goal percentage (53.7), three-point field goal percentage (58.9) and steals (1.3 spg). He averaged 29.1 minutes for the month and scored in double figures in eight of 10 games from March 9-28.

5e4b9037-bb6f-4990-ae2e-d90e3ab6818f  — A Brooklyn man has been charged in the robbery and shooting of New York Knicks player Cleanthony Early outside a Queens strip club in December.

A complaint filed in federal court says 22-year-old Delvon Dowling was part of a group of masked men who staked out the club last December.

Documents say when Early exited the club and got into an Uber car the group approached the vehicle with guns drawn. Police say Early was ordered out of the car, shot in the right leg and robbed of necklaces, gold caps from his teeth and other items.

Authorities say Dowling was arrested Friday on unrelated charges and admitted to being part of the crew that robbed Early. He didn't admit to being the gunman.

It's unclear whether has an attorney.
4f2c48f7-0df0-4a50-9b19-02120c1e41fe  Pistons vs. Heat (8 ET, TNT)

Playoff Implications

The intensity levels should be high in this matchup of two teams in the thick of a crowded Eastern Conference playoff race. The Pistons enter tied with the Pacers for the No. 7 and 8 spots, two games ahead of No. 9 seed Chicago and four games ahead of No. 10 seed Washington. Meanwhile, the Heat are tied with the Hornets for the No. 5 and 6 seeds and hold a 3½-game lead over Detroit and Indiana. The No. 3 through 6 seeds (Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Charlotte) are separated by just a ½-game with five or six games left for each team. With so much at stake, this matchup between Detroit and Miami should feel like an early playoff game.

Revving Their Engines

The Pistons have surged to a 7-2 record over their last nine games, including a huge win over the No. 9 seed Bulls on Saturday. Despite their success, the Pistons have struggled on offense over their last four games with an average of 91.5 points on 39.2 percent shooting. Detroit won its last matchup against Miami thanks to a game-winning 3-pointer from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. It was the Pistons' second win of the season over the Heat, with one win at home and one on the road. Tonight they battle in Miami, a place where the Pistons have lost seven of their last nine games. Andre Drummond, who has 64 double-doubles in 2015-16, is one double-double shy of tying Isiah Thomas for the team record for most double-doubles in a season (1983-84).

Pistons vs. Heat Reggie Jackson scores 18 points to help lift the Pistons over the Heat 93-92 on Tuesday night.

Looking To Reignite

The Heat surged up the standings after the All-Star break, but have cooled down over the past month with a record of 7-6 since March 9. Over this 13-game span, Miami is allowing 105.8 points per game, which is 7.3 points higher than its opponent season average. Dwyane Wade missed two of the Heat's three-game road trip due to back and neck injuries suffered against the Lakers. In two matchups against the Pistons this season, Wade has only scored a total of 21 points, including a career-low, 2-point performance on 1-for-9 shooting against Detroit on November 25. Hassan Whiteside is one double-double short of passing Udonis Haslem's season record (21) for the most double-doubles of the bench in Heat franchise history.

Timberwolves vs. Warriors (10:30 ET, TNT and League Pass)

Going For 70

With a win tonight, the Golden State Warriors will join the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls as the only two teams in NBA history to reach 70 wins. The Warriors need to finish 4-1 over their final five games to reach 73 wins and break the Bulls' iconic record. Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who was a member of the 1995-96 Bulls, says Golden State is "not really pushing" for the record, but after coming so far you know the Warriors have 73 wins in their minds with less than two weeks left. A win tonight would mark the first time in Warriors franchise history they have swept the Timberwolves in back-to-back seasons.

Steve Kerr Interview Kristen Ledlow interviews Steve Kerr about the Warriors injuries and his message to his team as they approach 73 wins.

Young Wolves

Minnesota has struggled again this season with a record of 25-52 entering tonight's action. Despite the poor record, the Timberwolves are one of the most fun teams to watch in the league thanks to young studs Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine. Towns, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, has been the brightest of these three future stars this season with averages of 18.2 points on 54.4 percent shooting, 10.5 rebounds and 1.7 blocks. He has 48 double-doubles on the season, which is good for fourth in the league behind superstars Andre Drummond, Russell Westbrook and John Wall. Tune in to see if the young Wolves can stun the Warriors at home and snap their seven-game losing streak against Golden State.

Chasing 400

Warriors Drain 1000th 3-Pointer of the Season Steph Curry pulls up and hits Golden State's 1000th three-pointer of the season.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the top two 3-point shooters in the league and have combined for 640 3-pointers this season. In comparison, the 1995-96 Bulls hit 544 3-pointers as a team during their historic run. Curry needs 22 3-pointers over his final five games to hit 400 3-pointers for the season, a number many never thought a player would reach. It would break the NBA's single-season 3-point record, which Curry set with 286 last season, by more than 100 3-pointers. Prior to Curry, the most any one player hit during a season was 269 by Ray Allen in 2005-06. Expect the reigning MVP to be firing from behind the arch tonight as he aims for yet another unbelievable milestone.

f46ec966-9432-452a-a276-6507536bb743  — Despite being elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday, Allen Iverson knows he still won't be able to shake his infamous rant about practice.

"I'm in the Hall of Fame and I can go outside today and go to a restaurant or whatever and somebody will say to me: `Practice? We talking about practice,"' he said with a laugh, adding that even his children mock him for the 2002 news conference in which he repeated the phrase about 20 times. "Man, I am a Hall of Famer and that's all you can think about - me saying practice."

Along with Iverson, Shaquille O'Neal, Yao Ming, Sheryl Swoopes, Tom Izzo and Jerry Reinsdorf were elected to the Hall of Fame on Monday.

Posthumous honorees this year include 27-year NBA referee Darell Garretson; John McLendon, the first African-American coach in a professional league; Cumberland Posey, who also is in the Baseball Hall of Fame; and Zelmo Beaty, who led Prairie View to an NAIA title in 1962.

The selections were announced in Houston in advance of Monday night's NCAA Tournament championship game between North Carolina and Villanova.

Iverson, selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft, was named rookie of the year and went on to become an 11-time All-Star. John Thompson, his coach at Georgetown, was there to celebrate the latest honor with his former player.

"I'm proud of the fact of knowing him as a person and knowing the challenges he's had to overcome," Thompson said. "Allen is legitimate. There's a lot of impersonators of what he is. But he is a kid who came from basically nothing and had to be thrust into a whole different way of life and been successful as he has been in his profession."

Iverson was asked to reminisce on the impressive dunking he did in his career despite being only 6-feet tall.

"I can't even touch the backboard now," the 40-year-old lamented. "I ain't lying. Like I can't even touch the backboard. It is over."

O'Neal, the top overall pick in the 1992 draft by the Orlando Magic, was the NBA MVP in 2000, a three-time NBA Finals MVP and 15-time All-Star. When he was introduced Monday at the media event, the jokester scolded the announcer for not mentioning his work in the 1996 movie "Kazaam," in which he played a genie.

The man who has a plethora of nicknames was asked if he hopes to get a new one when he's inducted into the hall in September.

"No, just Hall of Famer," he said.

O'Neal had a simple mindset when he entered the NBA, one that he got from his love of karate movies.

"In all your karate movies, you've got the young karate warrior and he goes all these places and he sees all these masters and he has to take them out," O'Neal said. "So I was gunning for everybody. I was gunning for all the superstars, I was gunning for all the big guys, because I wanted their spot and that was my motivation."

Yao, the top overall pick in 2002 by the Houston Rockets, was an eight-time All-Star. He did not attend the event because he was in Shanghai.

Swoopes helped Texas Tech to a national title, won four WNBA titles with the Houston Comets, was a three-time WNBA MVP and won three Olympic gold medals.

She grew up in the small West Texas town of Brownfield and hopes that her election can be an inspiration to children from small towns everywhere.

"For me to be sitting here today as a Hall of Famer I hope that all those kids out there that have ever doubted that things like this can happen to you, I'm a living example and living proof that if you trust in God and you work hard and believe in yourself and you surround yourself with the right people, anything can happen," she said.

Izzo, Michigan's State coach, won a national title in 2000 and has taken the Spartans to the Final Four seven times.

"This is the biggest thrill of my life," Izzo said. "I needed a lot of other guys to help me get here."

Reinsdorf has been the owner of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox for more than two decades.

"An award like this has to be the most important accomplishment you can have," he said. "The fact is I'm here because of what a lot of other people did."

892e1dd7-de98-45a1-b897-c8eb4d066e8d  — Brandon Ingram has made it official - he's the latest Duke one-and-done player.

The freshman announced the expected move Monday in a first-person story posted on The Players' Tribune website. Duke spokesman Cory Walton said Ingram is hiring an agent, which means he will not be returning to school.

The Kinston, North Carolina, native is the seventh Duke freshman since 2011 to head to the NBA, a run that started with eventual NBA rookie of the year Kyrie Irving and continued last year when three freshmen made the jump after winning the program's fifth national title.

Ingram averaged 17.3 points, matching the third-highest average by a Duke freshman in school history.

"On one hand, one year at Duke isn't a very long time. I know that," Ingram wrote in the story. "But I've done a lot of growing, and growing up, in that time."

The slender, soft-spoken 6-foot-9 swingman is widely projected to be one of the first two players, along with Ben Simmons of LSU, to be taken in the June draft.

The Atlantic Coast Conference's freshman of the year, Ingram was just the fourth freshman under coach Mike Krzyzewski to average at least 15 points and five rebounds, joining fellow one-and-dones Luol Deng, Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor.

"Brandon Ingram was a special player at Duke this year, and his best basketball is still ahead of him," Krzyzewski said. "He is a no-maintenance player who loves the game, has a strong desire to get better and competes every time he steps on the floor."

Ingram is leaving Duke early after arriving late: He didn't pick a school during the early signing period in November 2014 and didn't decide on Duke until last April, when he chose the Blue Devils over instate rivals North Carolina, North Carolina State and a list of other big-name programs.

His NBA decision came as much less of a surprise. Ingram was widely assumed to be headed to the pros after the season.

When Krzyzewski was asked before Duke's NCAA Tournament opener about the possibility of Ingram being a one-and-done player, the coach replied "yeah, he will" and added, "this will be the only time that he can play in the tournament."

In all, nine Duke players have gone pro following their freshman season and all of them were selected in the first round with guard Tyus Jones last year the only one that wasn't a lottery pick.

c86a0b15-0a34-4fec-a986-9ffd800c19b6  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

7547dc8b-af70-4002-ae48-1894aa8ab0b2  — The Golden State Warriors are preparing to play without NBA MVP Stephen Curry for Game 2 of their playoff series against Houston as he nurses an ankle injury.

Even if they know he will beg and plead to play through any pain. As long as he can't make it worse, Curry insists it will be hard to keep him off the court Monday night.

"Oh, yeah, for sure," coach Steve Kerr said of Curry campaigning to play. "When Steph's out, our guys understand that he's not there to count on, so they have to execute. If they don't, we're just not going to score enough points."

Kerr called Curry's status questionable again Sunday, when the point guard didn't practice a day after hurting his right ankle late in the first half of a 104-78 win over the Rockets in the playoff opener.

"Steph is a warrior. If he can play, he's definitely going to be out there," center Festus Ezeli said.

Curry was undergoing treatment on the ankle Sunday and unavailable for interviews.

"He's doing a little better than yesterday," Kerr said. "He'll get some rest, get off his feet and we'll do the same thing tomorrow at shootaround and see how he's feeling."

If Curry can't play Monday, Shaun Livingston will start in his place. The Warriors won at Houston on Dec. 31 without their superstar.

"It kind of changes things. We don't seem to be as good of a coaching staff when Steph goes out - I don't know why," Kerr joked after practice. "We've got a lot of guys who can play. I think Steph missed three or four games this year. We did fine. Obviously we've got to find different ways to score. We'll prepare for that and see what happens."

Golden State's backups have prided themselves all season in not losing a step when the second team comes into the game. In fact, contributions by the bench were a big reason the Warriors set the NBA record with 73 wins to top the 1995-96 Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls that Kerr played for.

"We're prepared. We're going to continue to play. We're ready to step in," said power forward Marreese Speights, who scored 12 points in 15 minutes off the bench Saturday. "We've got a lot of guys who can play and will impact the game. We know Steph, when his 30 points are taken off the board - or really 60 points with all the stuff he's doing on the court, playing defense, passing the ball, helping, controlling the offense - but we'll be all right."

Curry landed awkwardly shortly before halftime Saturday.

"I just tried to change direction, missed the shot, and tried to get back on defense, and then slipped a little bit and felt it slip or tweak," he said after the game.

Andrew Bogut knows it will take a lot for Curry not to play. The positive if he does sit is the Warriors have until Thursday to get him healthy for Game 3 at Houston.

"He's the MVP. Take the MVP out of the lineup and there will be some tweaks and changes made," Bogut said. "You know Steph's a competitor. He wants to play every game he can."
44732605-3394-4ef2-8797-767493f1c2dc  BROOKLYN, N.Y. -- The Brooklyn Nets have named Kenny Atkinson as the team's new head coach. Atkinson will become the 21st head coach in the franchise's NBA history. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released.

"We are thrilled to announce Kenny Atkinson as our new head coach and to welcome him and his family to Brooklyn," said Nets General Manager Sean Marks. "Kenny's years of NBA coaching experience working under successful head coaches such as Mike Budenholzer and Mike D'Antoni have provided him with the foundation and experience we were looking for in a head coach. We believe that Kenny's core principles, leadership, communication skills and exceptional background in player development make him an ideal fit for the culture we are building in Brooklyn."

Atkinson currently serves as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks and will continue in this capacity until the conclusion of Atlanta's postseason. With respect to the Hawks and their playoff schedule, a press conference to formally introduce Atkinson will be held on a date that has yet to be determined.

"I'd like to extend a personal welcome to Kenny and wish all of us success as we begin a new era at the Brooklyn Nets," said Nets Owner Mikhail Prokhorov. "Aside from his tremendous skills and experience, he has the mindset we need to build a winning team day by day, step by step. Together, we can do great things."

Atkinson joins the Nets after spending the past four seasons as an assistant coach with the Atlanta Hawks under Head Coach Mike Budenholzer. The Hawks made playoff appearances in each of Atkinson's four seasons, including the club's first-ever trip to the Eastern Conference Finals last season. The 2014-15 Hawks registered a franchise-record 60 wins, including a franchise-best 19-game win streak, and captured their first division title in more than 20 years. Atkinson served on the 2015 Eastern Conference All-Star coaching staff, and he guided Team World in the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend in New York. Prior to his tenure with the Hawks, Atkinson was an assistant coach for four seasons with the New York Knicks (2008-12), helping the team reach the postseason in 2011 and 2012. Atkinson also spent one season as the Director of Player Development for the Houston Rockets (2007-08).

"I am truly honored and humbled to be named the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, and I would like to thank Nets' ownership and management for this tremendous opportunity," said Atkinson. "Together with Sean and his staff, we look forward to building a winning tradition here in Brooklyn. I also want to acknowledge and thank Mike Budenholzer and the entire Atlanta Hawks organization for their cooperation and support throughout this process. While I am eager to begin working with the Nets, I remain committed to my coaching responsibilities with the Hawks for the remainder of the postseason."

A native of Huntington, New York, Atkinson has also held various coaching positions abroad, serving as Director of Player Development/Assistant Coach for Paris Basket Racing Club in France (2004-06), Director of Player Development/Assistant Coach for the national team of the Republic of Georgia in the summer of 2006 and as an assistant coach with the Ukraine national team at the European championships in 2011. Most recently, Atkinson was Head Coach of the Dominican Republic national team in last summer's FIBA Americas Championship in Mexico City.

Prior to beginning his coaching career, Atkinson played professionally for 14 years (1990-2004), beginning his pro career in the CBA and USBL before competing for teams in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. A standout collegiate player at the University of Richmond, Atkinson earned All-CAA First Team honors as a junior and senior and helped lead the Spiders to a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 1988. He was also selected as the 1987 CAA Rookie of the Year.

Atkinson and his wife, Laura, have a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Annika.
77c364c6-ead6-48b6-9cac-533156d06caa  — The Boston Celtics will likely be without their best perimeter defender for the rest of the opening-round playoff series against the Atlanta Hawks.

Guard Avery Bradley sustained a severely sprained right hamstring in the fourth quarter of a Game 1 loss.

Before the Celtics practiced Sunday at Georgia Tech, coach Brad Stevens announced that Bradley was out for Game 2 and probably won't return in the best-of-seven series. Bradley remained at the team hotel, undergoing treatment.

"Avery has a pretty significant strained hamstring," Steven said. "He'll continue to get treatment around the clock and go from there."

Bradley was injured near the midway point of the fourth quarter, crumpling to the court right after the Celtics had come all the way back from a 19-point deficit.

"I tried to go up and block (Jeff) Teague, and when I came down, I felt weird," Bradley said after the game. "I took a few steps and I just couldn't walk."

Without him, the Celtics struggled to contain Teague, who took control of the game in the closing minutes. The Atlanta point guard scored or assisted on 13 of his team's final 22 points as the Hawks held on for a 102-101 victory.

The series resumes Tuesday night in Atlanta.

"It definitely hurts our team," Celtics backup guard Marcus Smart said. "We lost another guy that brings it every night. Everybody else has to step up now."

The Celtics will surely be relying on Smart and Evan Turner to take on bigger roles, even though neither is as accomplished at the defensive end as the 6-foot-2 Bradley. Also, rookies R.J. Hunter and Terry Rozier could get more playing time. James Young, a second-year swingman, is another option.

The question is: What sort of rotation does Boston go with now?

The Celtics have largely relied on a starting unit that includes Bradley and 5-9 Isaiah Thomas in the backcourt, and no one taller than 6-9 up front. They could opt for a more customary approach - 7-footer Kelly Olynyk has started eight games this season - or go even smaller, putting up to four guards on the court at one time.

"We're playing small anyways, so you might have to go even deeper into that," Stevens said. "We'll have to decide if we're going to go with some of those young guys and ... play four smalls again, or if we're going to play more traditional again and go back to playing that way. We'll look at it and figure that out over the next 48 hours."

Bradley's value goes beyond the defensive end. On a team in which six players averaged in double figures, he ranked second in scoring at 15.2 points a game, and he scored 18 points in the series opener before going down.

"We really have to pull together," Turner said.

Smart scored 15 points in Game 1, going three of six beyond the 3-point arc.

He's confident the Celtics can carry on without one of their key players.

"It's not one superstar," Smart said. "It's a team. So this isn't anything new. Whether Avery was here or not, my responsibilities would be the same."

Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said Bradley's injury wouldn't affect the way the Hawks approach the series. If anything, it might enhance their focus after what happened a year ago.

In a second-round series against Washington, the Hawks struggled to put away the Wizards even though their best player, John Wall, missed three games with an injury.

"We're always more focused on what we need to do, regardless of who we're playing," Budenholzer said. "All coaches are experienced with having guys in and out of the lineup. Guys step up and do more when given the opportunity."

Without Bradley, though, it will certainly be tougher for the Celtics to slow down Teague, who finished with 23 points and 12 assists in Game 1. The Hawks could attempt to put further pressure on Boston's defense by putting Teague and backup point guard Dennis Schroder on the court at the same time.

"Bradley is a really good perimeter defender, and they've used him on both Jeff and Dennis at different times and for different stretches," Budenholzer said. "If there's an opportunity and it makes sense, we'd be comfortable playing Jeff and Dennis together."
2e16ae74-5763-4e60-8454-64c485c3f8ad  — Hawks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. is active for Game 1 of Atlanta's playoff series against the Boston Celtics.

Hardaway strained his right groin in the Hawks' regular-season finale against Washington. He was listed as questionable for the opener of the best-of-seven series, but felt good enough in pregame warmups to suit up.

Hardaway endured a rocky first season in Atlanta, playing only four of the first 35 games and even doing several stints in the D-League. But he's played a much bigger role down the stretch, giving the team another outside scoring threat off the bench and someone who can speed up the transition game.

Over the final 14 games, Hardaway averaged 10.2 points and hit nearly 41 percent of his 3-pointers.
eb7d0bb9-f33a-456a-9b8c-82423519eb37  — President Barack Obama has teamed with reigning NBA MVP Stephen Curry on a public service announcement calling for Americans to mentor youth in their community to make a positive impact.

The video was shown Saturday on ABC's "NBA Countdown" ahead of Curry's playoff opener with the defending champion Golden State Warriors against the Houston Rockets on Saturday.

Curry and Obama golfed together last August and Curry also visited the White House with the Warriors in February - and Obama mentioned Curry "clowning" with defenders the way he had been shooting.

The PSA was done through "MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership" and motivated by Obama's "My Brother's Keeper" initiative, which raises awareness and calls for action to ensure all youth - including young men of color - reach their full potential.

Curry is active in the Bay Area community and committed to making a difference.

After a recent visit to Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary in inner-city Oakland, he said, "The opportunity, obviously the 15-20 minutes you're with them, I think goes a long way. ... Just having fun with them is the most important. It was very beneficial."
5ae1d7b2-64a7-4302-9b70-907fd41495f8  — For both the Atlanta Hawks and the Boston Celtics, the NBA playoffs feel a lot different than they did a year ago.

The Hawks barely hung on to a home-court edge in the opening round after claiming the top seed in the East last season. Instead of being the team to beat, they're more of an afterthought this time around as they prepare to host Boston in Game 1 of the best-of-seven series Saturday night.

"There's probably less pressure," Atlanta guard Jeff Teague said. "It's almost like every team is on the same playing field."

Then there's the Celtics, who are eager to make some postseason noise after sneaking in last season with a losing record.

"We've got just a lot more confidence," Boston star Isaiah Thomas said. "We think the Eastern Conference is open for any team."

Two years removed from a dismal 25-win season, the Celtics were just glad to be there in 2015. They were swept in four straight games by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, but managed to stay competitive in every contest.

Now, they want more.

"We got a little taste and it was kind of embarrassing," Boston's Avery Bradley said. "We have a chip on our shoulder. I feel like we can go a lot further than last year."

Even though the Hawks followed up their franchise-record 60-win season by going 48-34, the players feel they are actually playing at a higher level going into these playoffs. Instead of having the luxury of resting up for the postseason, this team had to play hard right to the end.

"Last year, we just kind of cruised the last month and a half of the season," Atlanta guard Kyle Korver said. "I thought we lost some of our edge."

---

Here are some things to watch for in the Boston-Atlanta series:

STOPPING ISAIAH: Several Hawks players described Thomas as "the head of the snake" - in other words, the point guard is key to everything Boston does offensively. Even with a sore left shooting wrist, the 5-foot-9 dynamo managed to average 22.2 points a game and, when his shooting percentage dipped over the second half of the season, he made up for it by getting to the foul line more. "I'll be fine," Thomas said. "I've just got to work around it."

KORVER'S TREYS: Coming back from injuries, Korver spent much of the season trying to find his normally dead-on range beyond the 3-point arc. Over the final 22 games, he finally seemed to regain his touch. Korver knocked down 48 of 107 attempts (44.8 percent) during that span, providing the sort of outside threat that is key to Atlanta's spread-the-ball philosophy. While just about everyone in a Hawks' uniform is capable of launching a 3, Korver is the one who makes it all work.

LIMITING TURNOVERS: Both teams are among the best in the league at creating turnovers and feeding off those mistakes. Boston ranked second at 16.4 per game, while the Hawks weren't far behind at 16.1. The team that forces the most mistakes will have a big edge in the series.

HARDAWAY'S STATUS: When Tim Hardaway Jr. was riding the bench and toiling in the D-League, no one could've envisioned him having much of an impact on the playoffs. But Hardaway, after playing just four of Atlanta's first 35 games, finally broke into the rotation and became a valuable weapon off the bench. Now, he's slowed by a strained right hamstring sustained in the regular-season finale. Hardaway sat out much of Friday's practice and is listed as questionable for Game 1.

SEASON FINALES: The playoffs are a whole new season, but it will be interesting to see if either team carries the momentum (in Boston's case) or the baggage (in Atlanta's case) from the final night of the regular season. Boston pulled off a stunning comeback against Miami, rallying from 24 points down at halftime for a 98-88 victory, though it wasn't enough to secure home-court advantage. The Hawks, with a chance to move up to the No. 3 seed and possibly avoid top-seeded Cleveland in the second round, turned in a listless performance at Washington, losing to a Wizards team already eliminated from the playoffs and playing mostly backups.
c12b082d-84ca-4bac-9659-de7012023474  Denver Nuggets General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly announced a number of title changes today.

Jared Jeffries, who joined Denver's front office during the summer of 2013 following an impressive 11-year NBA career, is now the team's Director of Pro Personnel. The Indiana University alum's previous title was Pro Personnel Scout.

Tommy Balcetis has been named Director of Analytics after serving as Manager of Analytics since coming to Denver in 2013. Before arriving in Denver he spent two years as an analyst for Fidelity Investments and one year working in the NBA League office in London after graduating from Harvard University.

Scott Howard joined the Nuggets' front office prior to the 2015-16 season and now holds the title of Director of College Scouting. He came to Denver after serving as the Director of Scouting for the Charlotte Hornets franchise since 2008.

Additionally, coming into the 2015-16 season, Arturas Karnisovas received a new title of Assistant General Manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations.

On the basketball side, Steve Hess will now hold the title of Director of Performance/Assistant Coach and Head Strength and Conditioning Coach. The Ithaca College graduate is one of just six trainers worldwide on the Under Armour training council, is the official spokesperson for the National Sports Center for the Disabled and is a member of NBA Team Fit. The upcoming 2016-17 season will be his 20th with the Denver Nuggets organization.

Felipe Eichenberger also has a new title of Associate Head Strength and Conditioning Coach. He joined the Denver Nuggets in 2011 as the Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach. The Sao Paulo, Brazil native attended Northwestern Oklahoma State University where he was a four-year member of the basketball team and graduated with his degree in health and sports science. He also recently received his Masters in Kinesiology.
88236a43-3023-421e-bdc5-6e945ec59007  — LeBron James has been in the shadows, somewhat overlooked.

For months, the Cavaliers' megastar has been slightly under the radar, if that's even possible for one of the world's most recognizable athletes.

While Stephen Curry rained 3-pointers as the new face of the NBA, the Golden State Warriors hunted history and Kobe Bryant took his final bows, James remained in the background - waiting.

Well, it's time. Playoff time. His time. James appears more than ready.

"I'm in that mode right now," he said. "I'm where I want to be."

His body feeling as healthy as it has in several seasons, James, who finished the regular season with a focused flourish, is about to take aim at getting the Cavaliers back to the NBA Finals for another chance at slaying the three-sport dragon that is Cleveland's 52-year pro championship drought.

Following a drama-filled 82-game schedule during which they abruptly fired coach David Blatt despite a 30-11 record, James teased fans about his future and toyed with teammates via social media. Cleveland's talented roster too often seemed disinterested, but the Cavs are expected to win the Eastern Conference.

James won't settle for less. He can't settle for less.

There's only suitable outcome for James, seeking his sixth straight Finals and third title. He has to win it all.

And when the Cavs open the playoffs Sunday against the Detroit Pistons, James is in an unfamiliar role: underdog. He's not supposed to win it this year, which could even make him more dangerous.

More than anyone, he understands his window opportunity to win another title is closing. James is on the down slope of his career and knows Father Time is the only one who doesn't get posterized at the rim. The 31-year-old James, too, sees a juggernaut growing in Golden State and would like nothing more than to slow it down.

If his play over the past few weeks is any indication, and as long as he gets some help from Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and others, James could add a fourth crown to his resume.

After declaring he had shifted into "playoff mode" earlier than usual, James averaged 28.4 points on 63 percent shooting - 52 percent on 3-ponters - with 8.0 assists and 8.5 rebounds in his last 10 games. Because those numbers are attached to James they lose some meaning as he has established a personal standard unlike almost any player in league history.

"I hope he can keep it up," said coach Tyronn Lue. "If he plays like this, man, we're going to be tough to beat."

Perhaps most stunning about the way he closed out is that it came in the aftermath of a strange chapter in a most unusual season.

On March 19, James and the Cavs were drubbed by Miami, a team capable of re-routing Cleveland's presumed path to the Finals. As his teammates warmed up during halftime that night, James spent several minutes chatting with former teammate and dear friend Dwyane Wade.

It wasn't a good look for James, who later created more commotion by unfollowing the Cavs' Twitter account and being quoted that he wanted to someday play again with Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul. His behavior, and the fact that he has continued to sign one-year contracts with Cleveland, led to speculation he was planning an escape.

Something was going on, and both Lue and general manager David Griffin met with James to sort it out.

Since then, he's been on a tear, playing with a vengeance that has softened some critics and made others think that the Cavs might actually have a chance against the Warriors or whichever team survives the steel-cage match that figures to be the Western Conference playoffs.

"I'm just in a good rhythm," James explained after scoring 34 points in three quarters against Atlanta, his final regular-season game.

Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy has faced James in the playoffs before and must formulate a way to stop him.

Good luck.

"When you're preparing you have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D," Van Gundy said. "What you're really doing is throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something sticks. You can't just go in and have a blanket strategy how you want to play LeBron James. If somebody had the book on how to stop him, then this guy wouldn't be doing what he's done for 13 years in this league."

With his 179th career playoff game approaching, James, who averaged 30.3 points, 11 rebounds and 9.3 assists in last year's playoffs, is as energized as he was before his first. Since hugging Curry and walking off the floor with his head held high following a Game 6 loss in last year's Finals, James has been eyeing his shot at redemption.

This is when James shines like no other.

"I get that feel," he said.
d2b28a92-2034-4a5b-85ee-052afc878517  — Numbers do not tell the whole story when it comes to Dwyane Wade this season.

The statistics from this Miami Heat season scream that he's in serious decline. He's never shot worse, either from the field or from 3-point range. His scoring and assist averages were both the second-lowest of his career. He managed a mere two double-doubles, the lowest total in that department since his rookie season.

But his leadership seems strong as ever.

In a season where Miami rebuilt its roster, lost Chris Bosh for the second straight season at the All-Star break to a blood clot and made a surprising midseason decision to radically change its pace of play, Wade's leadership kept proving vital. He's about to make his 11th postseason appearance in 13 years; the Heat host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday in Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round series.

"I know I've got a big responsibility as a leader of this team to help lead these guys," Wade said. "It's in a different way than I've done with other teams. So for me, it's about meeting the challenge. Some games I'll be the go-to guy or the scorer, some games I'll give guys confidence. There's going to be a lot of different roles I play."

He helped convince Joe Johnson to come to Miami in February instead of accepting an offer from Cleveland, a move that has paid big dividends for the Heat. He's put in extra hours with Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow, two rookies who already have key roles in Miami's rotation. He's passed up his own scoring chances in order to throw lobs to Hassan Whiteside, Miami's breakout center.

When Heat coach Erik Spoelstra talks about Wade's footprint on this season, he points to a blowout loss at Toronto in January. Wade was urged not to even play because of shoulder pain, which was so bad that night that even putting on a shirt made him wince. Miami got dominated, dropped a fourth game in a row and fell to 23-21.

"That's the toughness of Dwyane Wade," Spoelstra said. "Him playing that night sent a message about what it takes to be successful."

Miami went 25-13 the rest of the way.

Part of the dip in the numbers is based on minutes, where Spoelstra kept Wade to an average of about 31 a night. And Wade still reached 25 points 17 times, the Heat going 12-5 in those games.

"I like how he's been able to change his game, not shooting as many 3's, still driving to the basket, still getting contact, still finishing, not only from mid-range but he still has his bounce on his jump shot," former NBA player and current ESPN analyst Jalen Rose said. "I really like what I'm seeing from him."

What Wade has done this year really started exactly 12 months ago, when the Heat sputtered in their first season without LeBron James, dealt with waves of injuries and illness - Bosh's midseason departure being the big blow - and missed the playoffs.

Wade decided he needed to change his body, slimming down more than he had in years.

"He was just knocking off pounds and getting his body right because he understood what he had to do," said Heat forward Dorell Wright, who was doing the same diet and workouts as Wade last summer. "The way he approaches the game, the way he's taken care of his body, he's still a smart player, great player and a crafty player. He understands the game so much more now. He's just a leader, man. He leads by example and always has."

And now he's back where he believes the Heat belong.

He's been to the NBA Finals five times, won three titles and knows not many are probably expecting big things from Miami in these playoffs. That doesn't mean Wade doesn't have high expectations.

"It does mean a lot to come back this year and put a team together that can do it," Wade said. "I look at the teams ahead of us and I say we're just as good as them. I truly believe it. We have to believe it as a unit. I'm waiting to see if we believe it."
c6c0bdac-aed6-4d00-b6d9-3abd83969f95  — Dirk Nowitzki's age-defying wizardry has been overlooked lately because of Kobe Bryant.

While the basketball world is still buzzing about the 37-year-old Bryant's 60-point outburst against Utah in his final game, Nowitzki, two months older than Bryant, is still playing. He leads the Dallas Mavericks into their first-round Western Conference playoff series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with Game 1 on Saturday night.

Nowitzki isn't just still playing at 37 - he's thriving. He led the Mavericks with 18.3 points per game this season. The league's No. 6 all-time scorer doesn't fire as often as in years past, but he's still dangerous.

"Physically, he would probably tell you he's not where he was five or six years ago, but he's still finding ways to be effective," 35-year-old Thunder forward Nick Collison said. "They're putting teams in really tough binds with how to guard their actions with a lot of the stuff they can do with his skill set. He's a guy I've got a ton of respect for. He's really good, and he's still doing it after all these years."

Nowitzki's shooting touch for a 7-footer poses matchup problems for most teams. Thunder coach Billy Donovan said his knowledge is just as important.

"I think any time, whether it's a Kobe Bryant or a Dirk Nowitzki, guys that have been in the NBA for a long, long time, I think the thing you can never underestimate is their ability and their experience and how many situations these guys have been in, and how they play the game mentally just as much as they play it physically," Donovan said.

Nowitzki has stood in the Thunder's way before: The Mavericks beat Oklahoma City in the 2011 Western Conference finals on their way to the NBA title. The Thunder swept the Mavericks in the first round the next year en route to the NBA Finals.

It's unclear how many more years Nowitzki will play, so Thunder forward Kevin Durant will enjoy the competition while he can.

"Dirk Nowitzki is one of my favorite players to ever play the game, so it's going to be fun playing against him," Durant said.
55539aa0-00f5-4520-9216-13abbcaf4a34  — Russell Westbrook's triple-double against the Los Angeles Clippers reminded Kevin Durant of someone playing the NBA 2K game on rookie mode.

Kobe Bryant took it a step further. After Westbrook logged a triple-double by halftime against the Los Angeles Lakers this past Monday, Bryant said Westbrook reminded him of himself.

"He is probably the most athletic player I've ever played against," Bryant said.

Westbrook takes the high praise and gaudy averages - 23.5 points and career-highs of 10.4 assists and 7.8 rebounds per game - into the Thunder's first-round Western Conference playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks. Game 1 is Saturday night in Oklahoma City.

"He plays the game with such an energy, with such an aggressiveness, and it needs to be appreciated," Bryant said. "He is not out there trying to be cute with the basketball. He is not out there trying to make friends. That guy is playing hard every time down. It takes a lot of energy to be able to do that, and he just never seems to run out of it."

After a triple-double against the Houston Rockets on March 22, Westbrook explained how he approaches the game.

"The game will tell you what to do," he said. "Like I've said all season, if it's scoring, it's scoring. Rebounding, that's what it is. Passing - whatever it is, the game will tell you what to do. And that's what I try to do."

Westbrook's 18 triple-doubles in the regular season led the league and, according to the Thunder, are the most since Magic Johnson had 18 during the 1981-82 season. His seven in March were the most by any player in a calendar month since Michael Jordan had seven in April 1989. The Thunder are unbeaten this season when Westbrook gets a triple-double, and 33-4 all-time. He posted triple-doubles in 10 of his final 21 games in the regular season.

Westbrook didn't post any triple-doubles against the Mavericks this season, but he helped the Thunder win all four games. He averaged 23.7 points, 10.3 assists and 6.7 rebounds in the three full games he played against them. He was ejected from the other matchup after an altercation with J.J. Barea.

The potential for major numbers exists for Westbrook in this series. Barea and Deron Williams, Dallas' primary point guards, have battled injuries the past few weeks, the last thing you want against the explosive Westbrook.

Perhaps the most impressive thing Westbrook has done is merge his game with Durant's after having a breakout season the year before. Westbrook dealt with a knee injury during the 2013-14 season, and Durant dominated during that stretch, helping him claim the league MVP award. Last season, Durant suffered several leg injuries, and Westbrook stepped in to become the league scoring champion and All-Star MVP.

Durant returned healthy this season and averaged 28.2 points per game, yet Westbrook still elevated his game. Thunder coach Billy Donovan said he never worried about whether Westbrook would be willing to share the ball after winning the scoring title.

"He knows right now, playing alongside Kevin, one of the best scorers in the world, that - he wants to win," Donovan said. "He understands Kevin's value. He understands how important Kevin is. He's going to play accordingly."

If the Thunder are to make a run, Westbrook will have to figure out how to become more efficient in close games. For the season, with the game on the line - the last 24 seconds of games with the score within three points - Westbrook has made 4 of 17 shots, including 1 of 9 3-pointers, according to STATS.

Many times, though, Oklahoma City's games aren't close by then, thanks in no small part to Westbrook.

"He's kind of slowed down to more of a point guard role," Thunder center Steven Adams said. "He's always been attack, attack, attack, which has been unbelievable, but now he's really getting all the teammates involved, and actually, that is opening himself up more."
219ef7f5-ba23-4706-bead-8875b1dc558b  — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors had their chance to celebrate their record-setting regular season before turning their focus to even bigger goals.

The 73 wins that put the Warriors in the record books and left the rest of the NBA chasing them all season are meaningless right now. When the Warriors take the court Saturday to open their first-round series against the Houston Rockets, they will be on even footing with the other 15 playoff teams.

"The regular season doesn't mean anything at this point," Curry said Friday. "We have two months to play our best basketball and compete and get it done."

Having successfully completed their chase for 73 wins to break the previous mark of 72 set by Chicago 20 years ago, the Warriors have targeted a new number.

With 16 postseason victories, the Warriors will have a second straight championship to go along with their single-season wins record and a case for having the most successful season in NBA history.

Anything short of that will make the regular season record somewhat meaningless, adding another level of pressure for the postseason run.

"That just goes with the territory," coach Steve Kerr said. "We're defending champs. When you're the favorite, it's a little different dynamic. Last year even though we won 67 games and were the one seed, people still wondered if we could get it done. It's a different feel, a different dynamic. We still have to win 16 games."

The chase for the record has provided the Warriors have been dealing with a playoff-style environment the past few weeks. There's been increased media scrutiny, the knowledge that any slipup could derail their chances and opponents playing their best in hopes of knocking off the league's top team.

Golden State has survived that gauntlet well with the exception of losing home games to Boston and Minnesota in a span of five days early in April. But the Warriors rebounded to win their final four games to break Chicago's record.

"Really all year we got everybody's best shot," Curry said. "Whether the atmosphere was there or not, on the court it felt like playoff intensity for the majority of our games. We feel confident we're ready for the moment."

Houston had to play it out until the end too, needing a win in the regular season finale just to clinch the playoffs.

The Rockets' reward is a rematch with the Warriors, who knocked out Houston in five games last year in the Western Conference finals.

"You have to face them anyway, either its first round or the Western Conference finals," star James Harden said. "We have a great opportunity. A lot of people are counting us out."

Here are some things to watch in the series:

RAINING 3S: The analytics-driven Rockets took the second most 3-pointers in the NBA this season with 2,533. But the Warriors are in a different league when it comes to long-ranger shooting. Despite taking only 59 more 3s than Houston, the Warriors made 199 more on the way to a record 1,077 for the season. Leading the way is Curry, who shattered his single-season mark of 286 by hitting 402. Klay Thompson hit 276 of his own - more than any player in NBA history other than Curry.

HANDLING HARDEN: Harden averaged 33 points, 10.5 rebounds and nine assists in losing the first two games of last year's series in Oakland. He struggled after that as the Warriors mixed in the bigger Andre Iguodala and Harrison Barnes defensively. Harden shot 3 for 16 in a Game 3 loss and then went 2 for 11 with 12 turnovers in the elimination fifth game.

BEVERLY THE PEST: The Rockets played last year's series without point guard Patrick Beverly, a defensive specialist known to irritate opponents. Teammate Jason Terry says Beverly can even pester his own teammates.

"Even on the bus, It doesn't even matter," Terry said. "It's Patrick. He's always going to get under people's skin."

QUICK TURNAROUND: The Warriors had been hoping to get the prime Sunday afternoon slot for their series opener and the extra day off that comes with it. Instead, they will have to play Game 1 on Saturday afternoon for the second straight year. That leaves both teams with only one real day of practice and no shootaround before the opener.

"I'm not annoyed. I'm just kind of surprised. But it shouldn't make any difference," said Kerr, who pointed out it was tougher on the Rockets because they had to travel.
ced5611a-4940-439f-9fb4-6605aa5fd895  — Coach Byron Scott expects to be a part of the Los Angeles Lakers' life after Kobe Bryant.

Scott said Friday that he anticipates returning to the Lakers next season despite presiding over the two worst years in the history of the 16-time NBA champion franchise.

General manager Mitch Kupchak says he'll meet with Scott and owner Jim Buss for lunch in a few days. They'll discuss their options for the Lakers, which finished with the NBA's second-worst record at 17-65 in Bryant's farewell season.

Kupchak made no guarantees, but praised Scott's work over the past two miserable seasons. The GM thinks Scott did well with a limited roster and a franchise built around Bryant, whose injuries and slowing play clashed with his enormous achievements and popularity.

"I think Byron has done an excellent job under the circumstances that he's had to deal with," Kupchak said. "This year in particular was a difficult year for a coach to wade his way through."

The Lakers are trying to begin life after Bryant, but nothing about the process is easy. Kobe carried this franchise to remarkable heights, but he left it at the bottom.

"It is hard to close the book on this chapter, but it has come to the point that we have to do it," Kupchak said. "It's something I don't think we'll ever see again, if you put it all together. One player, 20 years."

Bryant dominated the Lakers' payroll, offense and public image for much of the past two decades, including a $25 million salary and a ravenous shot selection in his final season. The third-leading scorer in NBA history scored 60 points on 50 shots in his last game Wednesday, but the electric victory ended the Lakers' worst season ever at 17-65.

An iconic franchise must redefine itself after Bryant's retirement. For the first time together, Kupchak and owner Jim Buss must figure out how to build a contender while working under the Hollywood spotlight that constantly shines on this team - and without the shade provided by Kobe.

"We've never had this many young players on the team at the same time, and there's a price to pay for that," Kupchak said. "The only way to move on after a player has played 20 years is to hope you can get some young players to build around."

Indeed, the Lakers have a core of youthful talent after drafting D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. over the past two years. If they finish the May 17 draft lottery in the top three, they will keep their pick and add another major talent in June.

Kupchak realizes the remaining Lakers wouldn't be an immediate playoff contender in the fall, and he intends to supplement the youngsters with free-agent talent. The Lakers could sign two free agents to maximum contracts after the removal of the combined $40.5 million paid to Bryant and Roy Hibbert this season.

But the Lakers don't have much to offer veterans outside of that money, a decent young core and this franchise's high profile - which repelled more big names than it attracted while Bryant still was in town.

Dwight Howard spurned the Lakers in 2013, Pau Gasol followed him out the door in 2014, and no high-profile names signed up last summer. Kupchak chooses to be optimistic, hoping a couple of big-ticket free agents could be attracted to the Lakers' mystique and promise without having to cede so much to Bryant.

"This offseason in some ways will be more difficult, and in some ways will be easier," Kupchak said. "We do feel this year we have a lot more assets on our team than we did last year, the last two years."
0d7257c3-fd47-49f6-a7b9-bd3aecc6082a  — Ties among teams that finished the 2015-16 NBA regular season with identical records were broken today through random drawings to help determine the order of selection for NBA Draft 2016 presented by State Farm, which will be held on Thursday, June 23.

8b15ea0d-c5cc-43f1-a1d4-80d29dbaf800  — Chris Bosh will still play a role for the Miami Heat in the playoffs, though apparently one that doesn't include him returning to the court.

The All-Star forward gave an emotional address to teammates before their first practice of this postseason on Friday, speaking about what playoff time means to him and how it pains him to be unable to play right now.

Bosh has been sidelined since the All-Star break - the second straight year that his season came to an end at the break because of a blood clot that started in his calf. Other than issuing a statement to announce that clot had dissipated several weeks ago, Bosh has not been available for interviews or offered any other updates on his health.

"Chris talked today to us, as a team," fellow Heat All-Star Dwyane Wade said after practice. "The biggest message is someone who lived for this moment, someone who envisioned these moments especially after last year, he doesn't have the ability to be in it."

Wade did not reveal everything Bosh said, but quoted him as saying, "You guys have an opportunity to be out in the playoffs. What I wouldn't do to be out there."

Heat guard Goran Dragic said he got goosebumps thinking about Bosh's message. Dragic said part of the meeting involved Heat coach Erik Spoelstra telling each player what their role would be, and then Bosh got called upon to speak.

"It's really tough for him," Dragic said. "He wants to be part of this on the court and it's really hard to watch and not to do nothing. It's a tough situation for him but we need him - even if he's not going to play, his ability to talk to the players, show what you're doing wrong, how you're supposed to do it on the floor, it's big time."

Bosh led the Heat in scoring this season, averaging 19.1 points in 53 games.

He said he was sitting out All-Star weekend with a calf strain. Soon afterward, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that he had been placed on a regimen of bloodthinners - just as he was a year ago. Athletes in contact sports are discouraged from competition while on bloodthinners, because of additional medical risks.

"With CB, it would be so much easier," Dragic said. "He can do a lot of different things."

Miami opens the Eastern Conference playoffs against Charlotte on Sunday. Bosh is expected to be on the bench for home games, as he has been for several weeks.
0b72b000-8d4a-404c-9652-3d31c5265e3e  NBA referees spent significantly less time reviewing calls this season as the NBA Replay Center stepped up its efforts to improve efficiency and maintain the flow of the game. The average review time was reduced by nearly 25 percent, dropping from 42.1 seconds during the 2014-15 season to 31.9 seconds.

Overall, the average review time has been trimmed by more than one minute since the state-of-the-art NBA Replay Center was unveiled last season to enhance the performance of NBA referees. A review officially starts when the headset is put on by an oncourt referee and ends upon removal.

This season, in addition to the three referees working each game, current NBA referees were staffed in the NBA Replay Center for all games to make decisions on certain replay situations and facilitate the on-the-court review of others. With the NBA Replay Center ruling on more than half of all replays, oncourt referees were able to resume play faster.

Final statistics for the NBA Replay Center during the 2015-16 regular season included:

• The NBA Replay Center conducted 2,296 reviews, averaging 31.9 seconds.

• The 1,228 games monitored averaged 1.87 reviews.

• The top two triggers reviewed were the two-point/three-point made field goal (764 instances) and end-of-period made field goal (527 instances).

The NBA Replay Center provides NBA referees with multiple camera angles on one screen at the same time, ensuring they have the best angles to make a ruling when a play is reviewable. Located in Secaucus, N.J., the facility is outfitted with 19 replay stations and more than 100 television monitors and is directly connected to all 29 NBA arenas, streamlining the process of instant replay video review.
937aa100-730f-4918-85f9-36b02ea4e32f  The following statement has been issued by Mike Bass, Executive Vice President, Communications:

"During a media availability earlier today following the NBA's Board of Governors meeting, Commissioner Adam Silver clarified that the NBA remains deeply concerned about its ability to successfully host the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, in light of recent legislation that discriminates against the LGBT community. At no time did Adam affirm that the league would not move the All-Star Game; rather he stressed repeatedly that the legislation is problematic, that we feel it is best to engage with the community to work towards a solution, that change is needed and we are hopeful that it will occur."
c7c50c1c-6fb4-424d-9129-e0ec26c89b15  — The Indiana Pacers' Frank Vogel and the Los Angeles Clippers' Doc Rivers today were named the NBA Eastern and Western Conference Coaches of the Month, respectively, for games played in April.

Vogel led the Pacers to the best record in the Eastern Conference at 6-1. The Pacers won their final three games and held off the Detroit Pistons for the seventh seed in the East playoffs. Indiana averaged 108 points per game and shot a conference-best 49.3 percent from the field in April. Four of the Pacers' six wins came by double digits, and their +8.6 scoring differential led the conference.

Rivers guided the Clippers, the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, to a 6-1 record, tops in the West. The Clippers surrendered 100 or more points just twice in seven games and held opponents to an average of 94.1 points on a league-low 40.6 percent shooting from the field. L.A. posted back-to-back home wins over two West playoff teams, the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies, on April 10 and 12, rounding out a 4-0 month at Staples Center.

Other nominees for Coach of the Month were Boston's Brad Stevens, Charlotte's Steve Clifford, Dallas' Rick Carlisle, Golden State's Steve Kerr, Miami's Erik Spoelstra, Portland's Terry Stotts and Toronto's Dwane Casey.
681aa482-b9ef-4157-8e18-ebddcfced85e  — The Toronto Raptors' Norman Powell and the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Rookies of the Month, respectively, for games played in April.

Powell helped the Raptors to a 6-2 record behind averages of 15.3 points (tops in the Eastern Conference), 4.4 rebounds (seventh), 2.5 assists (tied-fifth) and 1.4 steals (third). He scored in double figures in six of eight games and shot 54.8 percent from the field. In Toronto's regular-season finale, Powell scored a career-high 30 points on 12-of-18 shooting (including 5-of-6 from three-point range) and added nine rebounds and five assists during the Raptors' 103-96 win over the Brooklyn Nets.

Towns becomes the first player to sweep a season of Kia NBA Rookie of the Month awards since the Portland Trail Blazers' Damian Lillard in 2012-13. In April, Towns helped the Timberwolves to a 4-3 mark as he led all rookies in scoring (18.9 ppg), rebounding ( 11.7 rpg), blocks (1.7 bpg) and minutes (35.6 mpg). Towns capped his first NBA season with his 51st double-double (third most in the NBA) when he tallied 28 points and 14 rebounds during Minnesota's 144-109 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on April 13.

Here is a closer look at March for Powell and Towns:

705d34df-7139-4012-82e8-a4e1eda5399f  — The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James and the Houston Rockets' James Harden today were named the Kia NBA Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Month, respectively, for games played in April.

James, who captured his third consecutive monthly honor, led the Eastern Conference in scoring (28.8 ppg) while shooting 65.6 percent from the field (second in the East), including a conference-best 56.3 percent (9-for-16) from three-point range. He added 8.4 rebounds and 7.8 assists (third in the East) in a conference-high 36.9 minutes. James scored at least 30 points in three of his five games, including a 34-point performance against the Hawks on April 11, when the Cavs clinched the top seed in the East playoffs with a 109-94 victory. He also grabbed a season-high 16 rebounds in a 110-108 overtime win over the Hawks on April 1.

Harden led the NBA in scoring (34.8 ppg) as the Rockets closed the season 4-2 to secure the final playoff spot in the West.

69e1c180-7fb0-4bc9-9de0-53c373b55ee2  — Russia's main domestic security agency has searched the offices of a company controlled by the billionaire owner of U.S. basketball team Brooklyn Nets, Mikhail Prokhorov.

The Federal Security Service, the main KGB successor agency, said Friday the searches of ONEXIM group were part of a probe into alleged tax evasion. It added that the investigation is continuing.

Some Russian media have speculated that the searches could have been aimed at pressuring Prokhorov into surrendering control over his media assets. They include RBC, an online newspaper that has published reports critical of the Kremlin, including a detailed account of the so-called Panama Papers detailing offshore assets allegedly owned by top Russian businessmen and officials.

The searches on Thursday went on just as President Vladimir Putin held his annual call-in TV show. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov strongly denied any link between the searches and Prokhorov's media assets.

The 50-year-old Prokhorov, who is worth $8.2 billion according to Forbes, founded a liberal party and challenged Putin in the 2012 presidential election, winning 8 percent of the vote. He hasn't commented on the latest searches.

Russian authorities have frequently used accusations of tax evasion to crack down on unruly tycoons. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, spent 10 years in prison on charges of tax evasion and embezzlement which were widely seen as a political vendetta for challenging Putin's power.
f19d91cf-a7c7-4a65-9a7a-9385dfb77946  — The NBA will begin putting sponsorship logos on player uniforms in 2017-18, a move that could generate at least $100 million annually and a step that the NFL, Major League Baseball and NHL have yet to take.

The three-year trial was approved Friday by NBA owners and will take effect when the league's contract with Nike begins. The patches will appear on the front left of the jersey, opposite Nike's logo, and measure about 2½ by 2½ inches.

Logos appear on international and MLS soccer jerseys, and many athletes in individual sports wear their sponsors' attire in competition.

Commissioner Adam Silver had said going with logos was inevitable because of the potential to add revenue. WNBA and NBA Development League teams already have logos, and NBA clubs were wearing them on practice jerseys.

Silver called the plan an "experiment" and said it was hard to estimate how much revenue it would generate because teams would be responsible for their own sales, and some could decide not to participate. But he said it could be $100 million annually.

"I think the greatest impact will be on sort of this amplifying effect of a company choosing to associate directly with a team's jersey, then going out and promoting that relationship in the larger market," Silver said. "I think that will lead to greater engagement of our fans with these teams."

Owners also discussed a North Carolina law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people. Silver called it "problematic" for the league, but there was no decision on moving next year's All-Star Game out of Charlotte.

"The league believes that these groups need to be protected, but again, I think the right way to work to the proper resolution here is for the league to remain engaged in the conversation, rather than setting ultimatums or announcing we're not going to play our All-Star Game in Charlotte," Silver said.

There was also a presentation from Evan Wasch, the league's head of analytics, about ways the NBA could become more sophisticated about next season's scheduling to find further rest opportunities for players.

So the main business completed was the jersey sponsorships vote.

Besides the financial implications, Silver believes the sales can expand the league's growth oversees by drawing companies who want to be involved. He understands that fans who favor the traditional look might not like the logos, but will eventually see them as a way to improve the game.

"But there's a reason this is a pilot program," he added. "I mean, we listen very closely to our fans, and so we'll see what the reaction is."

Major League Soccer teams began selling jersey sponsorships in 2007, and they generate more than $6 million annually in revenues.

Adidas enters the final year of his contract as the NBA's official outfitter next season. When Nike takes over, its logo will become the first on league's jerseys - except for those of the Charlotte Hornets, who are owned by Michael Jordan.

The logo of his Jordan Brand, a subsidiary of Nike, could be on the Hornets' instead.

The sponsor patch will be adjusted to fit the dimensions of each sponsor's logo. It won't appear in retail versions of the jerseys, but clubs can sell jerseys with sponsor patches in their team stores.
32156097-eadf-487c-bef0-db3c9fbd4347  — The NBA Board of Governors approved the sale of jersey sponsorships, beginning with the 2017-18 season, as part of a three-year pilot program. The sponsorship patch will appear on the front left of the game jerseys opposite the Nike logo. Patches will measure approximately 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches and be adjusted to fit the dimensions of each sponsor's logo.

The NBA's 30 teams will be responsible for selling their own jersey sponsorships.

"Jersey sponsorships provide deeper engagement with partners looking to build a unique association with our teams and the additional investment will help grow the game in exciting new ways," said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "We're always thinking about innovative ways the NBA can remain competitive in a global marketplace, and we are excited to see the results of this three-year trial."

The sponsor patch will not appear on the retail versions of the player jerseys but teams will have the option to sell the jerseys with sponsor patches in their own retail outlets.
8b06a263-89c2-4f7e-b8b6-4d07a3832bf7  — Stan Van Gundy was given a mission when handed the keys to the Motor City's once-proud NBA franchise.

Win without sacrificing the future, Tom Gores told Van Gundy nearly two years ago when the relatively new owner of the Detroit Pistons hired a respected savant to be his coach and president of the basketball operations.

"He didn't want to tear it down, finish last and accumulate draft picks," Van Gundy recalled earlier this week in an interview with The Associated Press. "He wanted us to get the franchise up and running without trading away a lot of young players or draft picks for veterans who might help us win quickly. With a lot of moves, each one of them significant in their own way, we've actually gotten younger and better at the same time."

Van Gundy has helped the Pistons earn a spot in the playoffs for the first time since 2009, ending a drought that followed an eight-year run in which they were in the postseason every year, won an NBA title, almost repeated and advanced to six straight Eastern Conference finals.

LeBron James likely will end Detroit's feel-good story pretty quickly.

He and the Cleveland Cavaliers may very well sweep the Pistons in the first round, just as they did seven years ago with four lopsided victories.

Van Gundy, though, potentially gives Detroit a rare edge against the first-seeded Cavs.

The sturdy and seasoned Van Gundy has a ton of experience and Tyronn Lue does not as a head coach, especially in the NBA playoffs.

Lue will make his postseason debut as the leader of an NBA team on Sunday in Cleveland in Game 1, which will be Van Gundy's 88th playoff game.

Van Gundy is 48-39 in the playoffs. He led the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA finals - after eliminating the Cavs in the conference finals - and reached the 2005 Eastern Conference finals with the Miami Heat before losing to Detroit.

Dwyane Wade, whose rookie year was during Van Gundy's first season as Miami's head coach, is one of the many former players fond of him. Wade said he congratulated him on making it back to the playoffs during Tuesday night's game in Detroit.

"I know how hard he works," Wade said. "I know how much he cares, so I'm happy for the guy."

Van Gundy is a guy's guy, wearing white socks and sandals, comfortable clothes and sporting stubble on his face when he can. When Van Gundy is on the court for a game, he puts on a suit without a tie and has a clean-shaven look. Between games, he watches film relentlessly like an intern trying to impress the boss even though he's in charge of the entire operation on the basketball side of the business.

And when he doesn't like what he sees, behind the scenes at a practice or in public at the game, everyone can see it with his body language and hear it if they're within earshot.

"You've got to earn everything with him," guard Reggie Jackson said. "He's on top of all of us. There's no easy way out. Sometimes it's tough to take, but you can because you understand he's just trying to get each of us to be the best we can be."

Gores, who bought the downtrodden franchise near his troubled hometown of Flint, needed someone to get the franchise out of its rut of not being good enough to make the playoffs or bad enough to get one of the tops picks.

Van Gundy has done it, and Gores praises him for it.

"Stan deserves a lot of the credit," Gores said. "He came in really quickly and changed the culture."

The Pistons went through a series of coaches during good times and bad under Joe Dumars. They seemed to have figured out a way to stop the revolving door on the sideline by putting one person in charge of the front office and the coaching staff, potentially solving a problem Van Gundy noticed when he wasn't coaching an NBA team for two seasons.

"There are a lot of nightmares in the league in which the front office and the coaches are not on the same page," Van Gundy said. "I had no interest in being part of that, so I was careful about where I ended up. There's not going to be in-fighting here, but I have half-jokingly said that there has been times that the team president hasn't been happy with the head coach."
06355c1d-a166-476e-bb72-fdbb9970dcd2  — Hassan Whiteside is the NBA's new king of blocked shots. He just set a Miami Heat single-season record for rebounds per game. He's a few months away from signing a contract that should set him up financially for life.

In other words, he won.

Thing is, Whiteside doesn't want to talk about anything in those terms. He wants to be noticed, he wants to be celebrated, he desperately wants to be voted the NBA's defensive player of the year. But he also doesn't want to lose his edge, stemming from the pain he carries from all the times he was cut from a team or told he wasn't wanted.

"They know," Whiteside said. "They know they messed up."

The Heat are reaping the benefits, and Whiteside will make his playoff debut on Sunday when their Eastern Conference first-round series against the Charlotte Hornets in Miami. It's a doubly significant series for Whiteside - not only is it his first time in the postseason, but Charlotte is a mere half-hour drive or so from his hometown of Gastonia, North Carolina.

"He's come a long way this season, on and off the floor," Heat forward Udonis Haslem said. "I'm proud of him."

Haslem isn't the only one in the Heat locker room to share such sentiment. They know what Whiteside - who finished with averages of 14.2 points and 11.8 rebounds - has meant to a Heat team that won 48 games in the regular season and wound up as the No. 3 seed in the East.

The season could have fallen apart for the Heat at the All-Star break. Chris Bosh was diagnosed with another blood clot at the break for the second consecutive year and hasn't played since. Miami was sitting at No. 5 in the East, five games over .500 and not knowing that Bosh would be sidelined the rest of the way.

Whiteside didn't know how his role was about to change.

As the break ended Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and Whiteside had a brief meeting to talk about what was at stake for the team and for Whiteside's future in Miami. Whatever Spoelstra said worked. The Heat went 19-10 down the stretch, the fifth-best record in the NBA over that span and Whiteside - despite coming off the bench in most of those games - was a huge reason why, after raising his scoring, rebounding and free-throw shooting numbers.

"This basketball team needs him to play at his best level, his most aggressive level, his most consistent level, his most reliable level, his most dominant physical level," Spoelstra said.

That's what the Heat are getting.

There are still moments where he slips. Whiteside was ejected and subsequently suspended this season after throwing an elbow at San Antonio's Boban Marjanovic in February. Whiteside didn't think the criticism he got for that was fair, insisting that he didn't make contact on the play and saying it "got way more emphasized than any triple double, any stats, anything I ever did."

He atoned for that moment.

Whiteside led the league at 3.68 blocked shots per game, had three triple-doubles - the same total as LeBron James this season - and shot 61 percent from the field, another Heat single-season record breaking the mark previously held by Shaquille O'Neal.

"He came back and has really limited his immaturity moments," Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. "He's been growing on his own. He's been growing because he's been allowing people to help him. He's been listening more and it's all part of his success on the court."

Whiteside wants to stay in Miami and the Heat want him back, even though his price tag has risen big-time this season. It's a far cry from when he had to go to Lebanon or China to play, or when he was getting cut from D-League teams.

"I got cut three times," Whiteside said. "Or four. Five, maybe. I don't know. I got cut a lot."

Odds are, that won't happen again.
8649ba68-8927-40ac-bec0-4744ce47d82c  — For the regular season finale, the Portland Trail Blazers passed out T-shirts reading "Never Doubt Rip City."

Just in case there are still some doubters, the "never" is underlined.

The Blazers defied preseason expectations and made the playoffs, claiming the fifth seed in the Western Conference. They open their third straight postseason on Sunday in Los Angeles against the Clippers.

It's almost as if the Blazers succeeded despite the cynics.

"One person picked as what, 15 out of 15 in the West? I mean, the list goes on. I think everybody felt disrespected, like that's not what our season is gonna be," guard Allen Crabbe said. "It was everybody's goal since training camp that we were gonna play hard and it was us against everybody. Everybody stuck with that: We got better as the season went along and we had a helluva season."

Portland was expected to reach the playoffs last season - and did - with a starting lineup that included Damian Lillard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Wesley Matthews, Nicolas Batum and Robin Lopez. But Matthews' late-season Achilles injury messed with the team's chemistry, and they were eliminated in the first round by a strong Memphis team.

Going into this season, the playoffs seemed a longshot.

All the starters except Lillard departed in the offseason, and coach Terry Stotts was tasked with assembling a cohesive unit around his talented point guard. One oddsmaker predicted Portland would win about 26 games.

Lillard and backcourt partner CJ McCollum went on to pace a group that finished the regular season 44-38. The Blazers won seven of their final nine games to close out the regular season.

"It's going to be tough like it has been all season long. They're a really good team," Lillard said about the Clippers. "But we know that we have a chance. So we've got to go out there and be ourselves, lock in and be ready."

In the finale Wednesday night against the Nuggets, a 107-99 Portland win, Lillard broke Matthews' franchise record for 3-pointers and now has 828 for the Blazers. He averaged 25.1 points, becoming just the third Portland player to average more than 25 -along with Clyde Drexler and Kiki Vandeweghe.

"His four years here have been remarkable," Stotts said. "He just continues to shine - sometimes you run out of words."

McCollum averaged 20.8 points in his first year as a starter, giving Portland its first backcourt duo with an average of 20 or more points apiece in a single season.

The Clippers present an intriguing matchup with the recent return of Blake Griffin. Los Angeles won six straight before Wednesday night's 114-105 loss at Phoenix, with the fourth seed already sewn up and Griffin, Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Jamal Crawford left at home.

Whoever wins the first-round series will play the winner of the series between the defending champion Warriors and the Houston Rockets, a rematch of last year's conference finals.

It is the first time the Clippers and Blazers are meeting in the playoffs. The Clippers won the season series against Portland 3-1.

"We've been underdogs since the jump," Lillard said. "There's no pressure on us. I've already seen some people talk about the Clippers and the Warriors in the second round. So there's no pressure on us, we've just got to go out and play."
01032251-3af8-4fc3-b7b2-ed1dfaf8e4eb  — The Golden State Warriors' record-setting 73rd win generated a record local television rating as well.

CSN Bay Area said Wednesday's game between Golden State and Memphis got a 23.2 rating for the highest mark on record for an NBA game on a regional sports network. That means 23.2 percent of homes with televisions in the metropolitan area were tuned in.

The highest rating the Bulls got on SportsChannel Chicago when they set the previous wins mark in 1995-96 was 22.9 for their record-setting 70th victory.

The Grizzlies-Warriors matchup was shown outside of the Bay Area on ESPN, where it averaged more than 3.6 million viewers for the most-watched regular-season NBA game on the network in more than two years.

At the same time, Kobe Bryant's final career game averaged almost 3.5 million viewers on ESPN2, the largest audience ever for a regular-season NBA game on that channel. In the final minutes, after 1 a.m. on the East Coast, nearly 5.4 million people were watching.
0b33c464-f5f7-42b0-95a2-6a11c4f0f33d  — The Seattle Storm selected 6-foot-4 forward Breanna Stewart from the University of Connecticut with the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft Thursday night.

UConn's star averaged 19.4 points and 8.7 rebounds to lead the Huskies to a fourth consecutive national championship. She became the first player in NCAA history to earn most outstanding player of the Final Four all four years. Stewart is the fifth Huskies player to be taken first in the draft.

It marked the second straight season that the Storm had the top pick in the draft. Seattle took Jewell Loyd first last year. The team also had back-to-back No. 1 selections in 2001 and 2002 when Seattle drafted Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird.

Fellow UConn players Moriah Jefferson was selected by the San Antonio Stars with the No. 2 pick. Morgan Tuck was selected third by the Connecticut Sun.
5b1418ec-5476-4850-a524-ce29854bda7f  — Phil Jackson wants to work with a coach he knows, and he'll take some time before deciding if that's Kurt Rambis.

Jackson said Thursday that Rambis will be interviewed for the New York Knicks' coaching job after he finished the season as the team's interim coach. Jackson, the team's president of basketball operations, said he hasn't taken or made any calls about the position, which Rambis held since Derek Fisher was fired in early February.

For now, Rambis has a head start on the field.

"That's the only one I've said I'd interview right now," Jackson said. "I've resisted taking calls or making calls until the season's over and I have these exit meetings, but Kurt knows he'll be interviewed for the job."

Rambis was a former assistant coach under Jackson in Los Angeles and the two have a good working relationship, but he understands if Jackson needs to look around at other options.

"He's got to do what he's got to do," Rambis said. "That doesn't bother me."

The Knicks finished 32-50, their third straight season out of the playoffs, and there are a number of top candidates who would be available if Jackson opened a wide-spread coaching search.

That's what Carmelo Anthony indicated the Knicks should do.

"I think it should be open," Anthony said. "I think we should at least make it open and just like any other process, it should be open."

It may be - but only to a point.

Jackson was an 11-time champion as a coach who believes in a certain system of basketball that should be played. That will limit the options available and potentially eliminate someone like Tom Thibodeau right off the bat.

"Only people I probably know will be in the interview process," Jackson said. "I will reach out to make connections to some people, but I've been in this NBA over 50 years and I've seen a lot of situations where coaches end up coming in without simpatico with the general manager and those things don't work well. So someone who has compatibility with what I do, would have to be in sync with what we do."

Jackson gave no timetable, saying it could be July or it could be May.

The roster also needs plenty of work after the Knicks faltered badly following a promising 22-22 start. Besides the coach, the other question is whether will be a part of it next season.

"As of right now, I'll be here," Anthony said.

He has to approve any trade, so if he wants to stay, he will. But he no longer sounds so certain, recognizing that he may not be able to win the title he craves in the city he loves. He made the playoffs his first 10 years in the league before missing it three straight years as he enters the tail end of his career.

"When is going to come a time when I can compete at that level again?" he wondered.

Still, Jackson said they communicate and that Anthony "wants to stay here." Rookie Kristaps Porzingis hopes that remains the case.

"I need him, he knows that," Porzingis said. "I want to play with him in the future."

Biggest Need: Help in the backcourt. The Knicks' guards struggle to get into the paint and have trouble keeping their opponents out it, a bad combination.

- The Good News: Porzingis had a mostly terrific rookie year before it ended early with a shoulder injury that he said is feeling better. ... Anthony demonstrated better all-around play and leadership skills in his return after knee surgery ended last season early. ... Robin Lopez showed a solid offensive game in the post. ... Players still love New York and Madison Square Garden, giving them something to pitch in free agency.

- The Bad news: Don't have a first-round pick after trading it to Toronto three years ago for Andrea Bargnani. ... Jackson won't be sure how much the Knicks will have to spend in free agency until Arron Afflalo and Derrick Williams decide on their player options, and if both opt to stay, it may prevent them from being able to offer a maximum contract. ... Questions remain about the viability of the triangle offense that Jackson favors.
17f3d879-c45d-457f-a2cc-d3cd077af230  — The Sacramento Kings fired coach George Karl on Thursday after his first full season with the team, setting the stage for the team to hire its ninth coach since last making the playoffs in 2006.

General manager Vlade Divac announced the move a day after the Kings wrapped up another disappointing season with a 33-49 record. Karl was given a four-year contract when he was hired in February 2015 to replace Tyrone Corbin but never worked out and finished with a 44-68 mark.

"I feel bad doing this," Divac said. "But after what we experienced this year I thought we could do better and try to improve our team. I think George did a great job this year. But there was a part where there was a disconnect with the plays and the players so I made a decision to let him go."

Karl was unable to improve the team's defense, had frequent run-ins with star center DeMarcus Cousins and faced questions about his status as far back as November. His fate was officially determined Thursday, leaving the Kings to search for a new coach to lead them into their new downtown arena slated to open next season.

Karl is the eighth coach in Sacramento since the team last went to the playoffs in 2006 under Rick Adelman. Sacramento and Minnesota are the only teams not to go to the playoffs in that span and the Timberwolves are the only team with more losses than the Kings the past 10 seasons.

"There's no reason to blame George for all our failures this year," Divac said. "It's a lot of different stuff from me and the players. Just being in charge I felt like this is the first step in doing something I want to make sure we're on the same page."

The Kings have struggled for any stability, even after Vivek Ranadive bought the team from the Maloof family following the 2012-13 season and kept the franchise in Sacramento.

Mike Malone was fired 24 games into his second season as coach despite a close relationship with Cousins and some improvement on the court. Corbin took over in December 2014 but lasted just two months before the team turned to the veteran Karl, who has the fifth-most wins all-time with a record of 1,175-824.

But the man that hired Karl, former general manager Pete D'Alessandro, was replaced by Divac a few months after the move. Divac fired one of Karl's assistants, Vance Walberg, midway through this season and then parted ways with Karl.

While the Kings won 30 games this season for the first time since 2007-08, they once again missed the playoffs as Karl failed to fix the problems on the court. The defense has once again been a major problem with the team allowing a league-worst 109.1 points per game and giving up an NBA-record 839 3-pointers.

Then there were the issues between Karl and Cousins that boiled over last month when Cousins was suspended for one game by the team for yelling at Karl during a timeout huddle.

"While I would have loved to continue on this journey, I am very proud of our work and I want to thank Kings management for the opportunity to have coached this exciting team with such a bright future," Karl said in a statement. "It's my heartfelt feeling that the magnificent new arena will be hosting many playoff runs and an eventual championship, which the Sacramento fans, some of the most loyal and supportive people I've ever known in my many years in the NBA, very much deserve. With a profound humility, moving forward, I wish nothing but the best for this franchise and its players."

Divac now will look for a new coach who can get the best out of the immensely talented but sometimes difficult Cousins, who has had five coaches in his six seasons in the NBA. Cousins is coming off his most productive season, averaging a career-high 26.9 points per game, along with 11.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists.

"I feel our roster is talented, a playoff team, and we underachieved this year," Divac said. "I feel bad about this season but not disappointed. I'm in a position to do what I think is best for the organization. That's what makes me confident going into next season."
84af6e4e-6971-4433-a65b-78504dbc3434  With Yahoo! Fantasy leagues completed and champions crowned, we hand out fantasy awards for the 2015-16 season:

Most Improved

C.J. McCollum

A lot was expected from McCollum this season after the Blazers lost four of their five starters from 2014-15 in the offseason. The third-year guard not only met these high expectations, he surpassed them with a consistent (and efficient) season that helped Damian Lillard and the Blazers secure the No. 5 seed in the West. McCollum averaged career-highs in points (20.8), field goal percentage (44.8), 3-point percentage (41.7), assists (4.3), rebounds (2.7), steals (1.2) and minutes (34.8) while also tallying single-game career-highs in points (37), 3-pointers made (six) and rebounds (11). He missed only two games all season and scored fewer than 10 points in just one game. McCollum ended the season ranked 46th in Yahoo! fantasy, a great spot for a player drafted on average with the 99th pick. Don't be surprised if McCollum is drafted within the first three rounds next season.

Waiver Wire Wonder

Nikola Jokic

Few knew about the Nuggets' rookie when most fantasy drafts were held in late October. But fantasy owners quickly learned his name after a few weeks of action. The 41st pick of the 2014 Draft increased his production every month during 2015-16, finishing off the season with averages of 10.8 points on 48.9 percent shooting, 9.0 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.8 blocks in 24.8 minutes after the All-Star break. These stats put Jokic alongside Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, DeMarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, Paul Millsap and Thaddeus Young as the only players to average at least nine rebounds and one steal after the All-Star break. Pretty solid company for a player who went undrafted in most leagues. Jokic ended the season ranked 69th in Yahoo! fantasy and will likely be a top 75 pick next season.

Late Round Steal

The 31st-best player in NBA fantasy this season was drafted on average with the 125th pick. Crowder stormed onto the scene in 2015-16 with career-high averages of 14.2 points on 44.3 percent shooting, 1.7 3-pointers, 5.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.7 steals in his first full season with Boston. He did a little bit of everything to join James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Robert Covington and Stephen Curry as the only players to average at least five rebounds, 1.5 3-pointers and 1.5 steals this season. Crowder posted numbers similar to what many fantasy owners expected from the Spurs' Danny Green, who disappointed after being drafted on average with the 58th pick. Expect Crowder to be selected around that range during 2016-17 fantasy drafts.

Early Round Bust

The fantasy world (and the Jazz) expected a lot out from Gobert after a dominant finish to the 2014-15 season. However, injuries derailed the big man early on in 2015-16 and he was never able to live up to his high draft slot. Gobert averaged 9.1 points on 55.9 percent shooting, 11.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks, which are great numbers for a 23-year-old center in their third NBA season. But these numbers are way below the expectations for a player selected on average with the 17th pick in Yahoo! fantasy drafts, ahead of elite fantasy performers like Paul Millsap, Draymond Green and Kyle Lowry. There's still a lot to like about Gobert and he will likely be a high pick again this October. However, learn your lesson from this season and avoid drafting him before the third round. He simply doesn't score enough to be selected that high.

LVP

The Knicks superstar takes home the unglamorous distinction for the second year in a row. There were clearly worse players than Anthony this season, and he wasn't even bad! But for a player drafted on average with the 11th overall pick, Anthony disappointed again. The nine-time All-Star averaged 21.8 points (his lowest mark since 2004-05) on 43.4 percent shooting, 1.5 3-pointers, 7.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 72 games. He failed to tally a 40-point game for the first season since 2004-05 and only surpassed 30 points in four games. Again, these aren't bad numbers. But they're simply not good enough for a player selected on average ahead of Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard and John Wall. If you used a top 12 pick on Anthony this season, you probably had a difficult year.

MVP

Stephen Curry

Who else? The reigning MVP pushed his game to new heights in 2015-16 with absurd averages of 30.1 points on 50.4 percent shooting, 5.1 3-pointers made on 45.4 percent from deep, 6.7 assists, 5.4 rebounds and 2.1 steals over 79 games. He broke countless records, including his own single-season 3-point record by 116 3s. He joined Larry Bird, Kevin Durant and Dirk Nowitzki as the only players to shoot at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point and 90 percent from the free throw line for a season. And he averaged more points than all of them during their 50-40-90 seasons. Curry was the fantasy leader in points, 3-pointers and steals, which makes it likely the championship team in your league had Curry on its roster. There was debate coming into the season about who should go No. 1 overall between Curry and Anthony Davis. Safe to say that debate won't occur next season.
d6e0080b-a527-421b-affe-e2f3dfc156da  — Ernie Grunfeld is sticking around as president of the Washington Wizards, saying at a news conference that he would be "heading up the coaching search" to replace the fired Randy Wittman.

Grunfeld, with the Wizards since 2003, met with the media on Thursday, a day after Wittman was told he wouldn't be returning as coach and the regular season ended with Washington at .500 and out of the playoffs.

Grunfeld lamented a lack of consistency under Wittman this season, after having reached the second round of the playoffs the previous two years.

Says Grunfeld: "We all feel like we missed an opportunity."

Grunfeld says "a lot of candidates" will want what he described as a "desirable" coaching job and some have "already shown their interest."
aa181c88-645f-4872-8456-24f79d6fcec1  The greatest NBA team of all-time debate is endless. Some list the 1985-86 and 2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers, the 1986-87 Boston Celtics and the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls as worthy candidates. One title not up for debate? The team with the greatest season of all-time, the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.

The Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 125-104 on Wednesday for an NBA-record 73rd victory. The 1995-96 Bulls held the record for 20 years before that and it was a mark once touted an unreachable.

So exactly how did the Warriors do the unthinkable?

Grizzlies vs. Warriors Stephen Curry explodes for 46 points, with ten threes notching over 400 3-pointers in a season, and leads Golden State over Memphis to notch the Warriors' historic 73rd win to set an NBA record.

It begins with a 24-0 start to 2015-16, which placed them two games ahead of the 22-2 start the '95-96 Bulls got off to. The Warriors confidence and swagger continued to build in this hot start, boasting a 14.2 points per game differential through the first 24 games. With a two game head start on the once perceived greatest season of all-time, why not go for the record?

"We weren't even thinking about it [73 wins] that far back in the season," Warriors All-Star guard Klay Thompson said. "These last two weeks it's been in the back of our minds but we knew that at any point anything could happen. Injuries could take place, guys could go down and we'd just have to step up. But we really hadn't thought about it until recently."

They may not have discussed chasing the record, but the plan was in motion. During their run to the 2015 NBA championship, the Warriors set one lofty goal: never to lose three consecutive games. After accomplishing that, they entered this season with the goal of not losing two games in a row. Golden State responded with five different win streaks of seven games or more, becoming the first team to go an entire 82-game season without back-to-back defeats. The Warriors were 9-0 this season following a loss, outscoring opponents by 14.6 points in such games.

It's one thing to avoid two straight losses and quite another to play at a high level on two consecutive nights. The Warriors led the NBA with an 18-2 record on the second night of back-to-backs, when teams' play or energy level often drops. In contrast, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference and were a dismal 11-8 on zero days' rest.

Curry Makes His 400th Three of the Season With this Andrew Bogut assist, Stephen Curry makes his 400th three-pointer of the season, breaking his own record set just last year.

Just four seasons ago, the Warriors were a 23-win team. This season, Golden State won 34 games alone on the road, surpassing those '95-96 Bulls' mark of 33. The Warriors had two separate seven-game road trips this season and went 6-1 on each of them.

As hard as the road can be, Golden State's foes may have it worst off when visiting the Wariors' home arena. For the second consecutive season the Warriors transformed Oracle Arena into a historical arena of sorts with a 39-2 mark that matched the franchise home wins record set in '14-15. However, the two home losses came late in the season and many wondered if 73 wins were still within reach ... except the Warriors.

"A lot of things had to fall in place in order to get this record," forward Harrison Barnes said. "We never made a decision about whether or not we're going to go for it. After the Minnesota loss [at home], we would just go to Memphis and see what happens and go to San Antonio and see what happens. I don't think we were ever worried."

Worry never seemed to be in the team's vocabulary and was not apparent when they faced other elite teams. Golden State was a combined 14-1 against 50-win teams this season and their lone loss was to the San Antonio Spurs (who set a franchise record with 67 wins). In short, they dominated everyone, going 26-2 versus the Western Conference's playoff teams and an impressive 27-3 against the Eastern Conference.

Not only were the Warriors dominant at home and on the road, but their best quality seemed to be their ability to remain calm in close game situations. The Warriors were 6-1 in overtime games and 29-4 in games decided by single digits. So while Golden State may not have discussed a plan to win 73 games, they had a perfect blueprint to do so.

Driving this Warriors run to 73 was the reigning Kia MVP, Stephen Curry (who has more than an inside track on the 2016 award and perhaps Kia Most Improved Player, too). Curry's scoring average improved by 6.3 points per game, the highest improvement in NBA history by a reigning MVP. He led the NBA in scoring at 30.1 points, recording a league-best 40 games with 30 or more points. He also became the seventh member of the 50-40-90 club (50 percent or better on field goals, 40 percent or better on 3-pointers, 90 percent or better on free throws) with marks of 50.4 percent, 45.3 percent and 90.8 percent, respectively.

Most Improved MVP? A look at the biggest scoring increases by an MVP in NBA history. Player MVP season PPG Next season PPG Increase Stephen Curry 23.8 (14-15) 30.1 +6.3 Larry Bird 24.2 (83-84) 28.7 +4.5 Steve Nash 15.5 (04-05) 18.8 +3.3 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 31.7 (70-71) 34.8 +3.1 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 27.0 (73-74) 30.0 +3.0

With all that Curry's done this season, he managed to prove he is perhaps the best shooter the league has ever seen. He became the first player in league history to amass 400 3-pointers in a season (402), besting his own NBA-record mark (set last season) of 286. And apparently, Curry's shooting ability was contagious as the Warriors set an NBA record with 1,077 3-pointers (no team had ever reached the 950 3-pointers mark prior to this season).

Most 3-pointers made in single season, team 3-pointers made Team (Season) 1,077 Golden State Warriors (2015-16) 933 Houston Rockets (2014-15) 891 New York Knicks (2012-13) 883 Golden State Warriors (2014-15) 867 Houston Rockets (2012-13)

Although Curry may receive the bulk of the praise, the team could not have accomplished their goals without trusting the entire roster. Golden State became the first team since the '85-86 Lakers to record 43 games with 30 or more assists in a single season. If the Warriors wanted to be remembered as the team of the century, they can let their game do the talking. The Warriors scored 100 or more points 75 times this season, the most by any team since 1991-92 (when the Warriors, Bulls and Indiana Pacers all did so at least 75 times).

Based on the numbers, the Warriors produced the greatest regular season in NBA history. However, their larger goal remains repeating as NBA champions. So how can the Warriors end the debate about the greatest team in NBA history? Simply by becoming the first team to go 16-0 in postseason play.

"16-0?" forward Andre Iguodala asked after winning their 73rd game. "We're going to take it game by game. It can get out of whack when you chase things like that. Besides, it's already written. So for me it's just taking it one game at a time and enjoying the whole process."
e0b424ec-9c39-4e39-9379-81d0f2b8f1bc  — The NBA had a record-setting season in the stands and on the screens.

The league said Thursday it broke its attendance mark for the second straight season, drawing nearly 22 million fans in 2015-16.

The average attendance of 17,864 also was a record, including the 723 sellouts and 94 percent average arena capacity.

NBA TV had its most viewers this season as part of a year of growth for NBA Digital.

The network averaged 345,000 total viewers during the regular season, a 19 percent increase over 2014-15. It drew a record number of viewers for its April 10 tripleheader, highlighted by Golden State's victory over San Antonio in the nightcap.

That game drew an average of 2.6 million viewers, the most for a game on NBA TV.

NBA Digital also says NBA League Pass, NBA.com and the NBA App had increases in views, visits and downloads. It says the 9.1 billion video views on the website and app was a 160 percent increase over last season.
4e1d294e-4aad-4038-9d46-32fb1612249e  — Randy Wittman will not be back as coach of the Washington Wizards, let go after failing to reach the playoffs this season.

The team announced Thursday that it would not pick up its option on Wittman's contract.

Wittman was informed of the news Wednesday night, when the Wizards' season ended with a 109-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. With a team built around All-Star point guard John Wall, and a roster set up to make a bid for Kevin Durant as a free agent this offseason, Washington finished 41-41 and 10th in the Eastern Conference.

The Wizards missed out on the playoffs after reaching the second round each of the past two seasons.

"There were high internal and external expectations for this team coming into this season, based on the momentum we had generated over the previous two years," Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said. "Unfortunately, the inconsistency of the team's performance and effort, particularly on our home court, did not allow us to meet those expectations and we decided a coaching change was needed."

In all, Wittman went 178-199 in 4 1/2 seasons with the Wizards, a winning percentage of .472. That lifted his career NBA coaching percentage to .406.

"Randy should be commended for the job he did in taking over as head coach during a very difficult time for our franchise," Grunfeld said, "and for helping to establish a culture and identity that led to success."

After the season finale Wednesday, Wittman was asked about his job status and offered a defense of the job he did in Washington.

"I love this job. I'm going to come to work until they tell me I can't. I'm proud of what we've done here. I took over 4 1/2 years ago, and this was a sideshow," Wittman said. "And we slowly changed the culture of this team. And we had a slip-up this year."

He continued: "I'm proud of the work that I've done here. I really am. I'm proud of our guys. They played hard all the way to the end, playing for nothing. They gave me that. I'll be here first thing in the morning. So if you want to come by, I'll be here."

About an hour later, Wittman could be heard near his office, offering a goodbye to a team employee.

Last season, the Wizards went 46-36 and were seeded fifth in the East for the playoffs. They knocked off the Toronto Raptors in the first round, then bowed out in six games against Atlanta after Wall broke bones in his left hand and wrist in Game 1.

After success using Paul Pierce as a stretch-4 during those playoffs, the Wizards tried to install a full-fledged pace-and-space system this season - although without Pierce, who left for the Los Angeles Clippers as a free agent.

The strategy never fully worked. Washington's defensive play - the foundation of the success Wittman had with the team - took a major step back this season, and injuries up and down the roster didn't help matters.

In a wide-ranging news conference before Wednesday's game, which he sat out because of a swollen knee, Wall acknowledged that he and Wittman had a shouting match at practice late in the season. But he added that the pair has "a great relationship."

"He's been here (as an assistant or head coach) every year I've been in the NBA. He's helped me become a better player, improving me as a person. And just how he has been coaching us, we became a better defensive team. We made the playoffs because of him," Wall said. "He's doing the best he can with the group of guys he has out there."
f25549b6-7ce7-4f99-be2b-43b7dd3e051b  — The Washington Wizards announced today that they will not pick up the option on the contract of Head Coach Randy Wittman.

"There were high internal and external expectations for this team coming into this season based on the momentum we had generated over the previous two years," said Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld. "Unfortunately, the inconsistency of the team's performance and effort, particularly on our home court, did not allow us to meet those expectations and we decided a coaching change was needed."

Wittman was originally promoted to head coach on January 24, 2012, and compiled a 178-199 (.472) overall record in four-and-a-half seasons with the Wizards. During his tenure, the team advanced to the second round of the playoffs twice (2014 and 2015).

"Randy should be commended for the job he did in taking over as head coach during a very difficult time for our franchise and for helping to establish a culture and identity that led to success," said Grunfeld. "This was a very tough decision on a personal level, and we wish Randy and his family the best moving forward."
bb6ebd41-921d-4482-90b6-ade2742867aa  — Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.

And with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.

"What else can I say?" Bryant asked. "Mamba out."

Now that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.

Bryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.

He scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.

It was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.

"It's hard to believe it happened this way," Bryant said. "I'm still shocked about it."

With the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.

"The perfect ending would have been a championship," Bryant said with a smile. "But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time."

Bryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.

Kobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 60 points in an NBA game with his highest-scoring performance since getting 61 against New York in 2009 - oh, and he had four assists and four rebounds.

The Lakers sprayed him with champagne in the locker room, although he didn't like it: "That's only for championships."

It was still one last classic from the Black Mamba.

"It just didn't surprise me, the way he would go out," said Lakers coach Byron Scott, Bryant's teammate in his rookie season. "Sixty points wasn't a surprise. I knew he had it in him."

The entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.

"I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout," Bryant said to the crowd. "You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys."

He also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.

"The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball," Bryant said with a grin. "And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!"'

It was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant "the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years" and "the greatest to wear the purple and gold."

Bryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.

It was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.

After blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.

Bryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.

The Lakers snapped a six-game skid in their final outing, but their demanding fans could forget about the awful season for one night.

Trey Lyles scored 18 points and Gordon Hayward had 17 for the Jazz, who were eliminated from playoff contention shortly before tipoff by Houston's win over the Sacramento Kings. The Jazz played defense, but Bryant's persistence wore them down.

"We weren't trying to let him go off on a win," said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. "As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently."

TIP-INS

Jazz: Utah has missed the playoffs in four straight seasons, its longest drought since 1980-83. ... The Jazz rested Trey Burke, Derrick Favors and Alec Burks. Favors and Burks have right knee soreness.

78ba4f76-8104-45ba-ae3d-47ab9db28111  — Randy Wittman has been told he will not be back as coach of the Washington Wizards, let go after failing to reach the playoffs this season, according to a person familiar with the decision.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the move had not been announced by the team.

Wittman was informed of the news Wednesday night, when the Wizards' season ended with a 109-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. With a team built around All-Star point guard John Wall, and a roster set up to make a bid for Kevin Durant as a free agent this offseason, Washington finished 41-41 and 10th in the Eastern Conference.

045ba7c0-b4b2-4fdd-baad-ef65e49fbc25  — The Minnesota Timberwolves have announced Sam Mitchell has been relieved of his interim head coaching duties, effective immediately, and the team will initiate a search for both a new head coach and a new head of basketball operations. Due to the sudden onset of Flip Saunders' illness leading to his untimely death, the team was unable to conduct a search for these two critical positions in the timetable leading up to the start of the 2015-16 season. In these unusual circumstances, Sam Mitchell was named to interim head coach and Milt Newton was asked to act as the head of basketball operations, filling the void left by Saunders.

With the conclusion of the season a comprehensive search can take place to fill both vacancies. To manage the search process the team has retained the services of Korn Ferry whose sports practice includes extensive experience in coaching, executive and team personnel searches. The search will focus exclusively on candidates outside the current organization.

"The future of the Minnesota Timberwolves has never been brighter," said Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. "It's important that we find the best leaders to shape our talented team and help them realize their full potential. We owe it to our fans, our community and to our players to ensure our team has the best chance possible of winning an NBA title.

"I would like to thank both Sam and Milt for a good job under very difficult circumstances in guiding our team this season," said Taylor. "They were put in a historically challenging position as no team in NBA history has had an active head coach pass away. Both men provided our team with continuity and direction for the 2015-16 season. We will always be grateful to Sam for his contributions this season and wish him and his family the best in the future."

The team's search for these two basketball leadership positions will be wide-ranging and extensive. Milt Newton will continue to serve as General Manager as the new leadership team is assembled. No timeline has been set and no further updates will be provided until the conclusion of the searches.
29797e56-7534-4e68-9fbe-ce7c81065a3e  — The Minnesota Timberwolves are embarking on a massive overhaul of their leadership and have hired a search firm to look for a new president of basketball operations and coach, the team announced late Wednesday night.

The search begins with candidates exclusively outside the organization, meaning GM Milt Newton and coach Sam Mitchell will not be considered for the openings. Two people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that ESPN analyst Jeff Van Gundy, former Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau and former Thunder coach Scott Brooks are among the candidates who are targeted. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the team was not publicly commenting on the specifics of the search for a permanent replacement for president and coach Flip Saunders, who died from Hodgkin's lymphoma in October.

"The future of the Minnesota Timberwolves has never been brighter," Wolves owner Glen Taylor said in a statement issued by the team. "It's important that we find the best leaders to shape our talented team and help them realize their full potential."

The new president will make a determination on Newton's future with the team. Mitchell said before the season finale against the Pelicans on Wednesday night that he was holding out hope to be brought back, but initial indications are that he faces extremely long odds to be retained.

Taylor has hired search firm Korn Ferry to help in the search for a new coach, one that could end up giving the coach executive powers as well.

Saunders held both the coach and president of basketball operations titles and candidates such as Van Gundy, whose brother Stan holds dual roles in Detroit and Thibodeau could push for executive positions as well.

It was an aggressive move for Taylor, who has a history of sticking with those in the organization who have known him for a long time. Mitchell has known Taylor for two decades dating back to his time as a player with the Wolves and led the team to 12 more victories than they had last year heading into the final game.

But Taylor hired headhunter Jed Hughes to help him assemble a leadership team to provide stability at the top of a team loaded with young talent. He also appears to be intent on opening his wallet to land some high-profile leadership to help end the Wolves' 12-year playoff drought.

Mitchell said he spoke with Taylor on Wednesday morning.

"He's very pleased with the job I've done and what we've done as a staff," Mitchell said.

"But I think he feels like he owes it to the organization to make sure that he gets the person he's most comfortable with. I still feel like I'm the person, but he has to do his due diligence and I respect that."

The job or jobs, depending on who is hired, figure to be among of the most attractive on the market this spring with promising youngsters Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine headlining an athletic group. The Wolves also have a new practice facility and are beginning renovations on Target Center.

Mitchell placed in an incredibly difficult position when he was thrust after his friend Saunders died just days before the season tipped off.

Following a rocky January that dropped the Wolves to 14-36, Mitchell made several key adjustments and played a big role in developing the team's copious young talent.

"It's been huge," Wiggins said of the guidance from Mitchell and the rest of the coaches. "They put me in positions to succeed. They've never steered me wrong."

The Wolves won three straight games on the road last week, including an overtime victory at defending NBA champion Golden State. A 14-17 record over the past six weeks.

Many thought Taylor would stick with Mitchell after the signs of progress, but a woeful home record and a low public approval rating with fans could have played a role in Taylor's decision.

"I would be disappointed if something was promised to me, but it wasn't," Mitchell said. "I sat down with Mr. Taylor when he asked me to take over and no guarantees or promises were made. We knew this day was going to come. He's doing what he has to do as an owner of the team and this organization."

Newton was not immediately available for comment.

About two weeks ago Taylor said that Newton would remain as the primary decision-maker and run the draft and free agency before the owner made a full evaluation of the job he has done. But he appears to have changed that stance and now will leave that decision up to the new president.

Taylor thanked Newton and Mitchell for their work while put in a "historically challenging position."

Hughes has led many national searches in the NFL, the NBA and the NCAA, helping place Jim Harbaugh at Michigan, Stan Van Gundy with the Pistons and GM Masai Ujiri with the Toronto Raptors.
9be6c6c6-5414-45c9-bfb9-c40b57e5256f  — The Houston Rockets will get another shot at Golden State, while the Miami Heat took the hard way to a No. 3 seed.

The Rockets earned the final NBA playoff spot Wednesday night with a 116-81 victory over Sacramento, giving them the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference and officially making Kobe Bryant's final game nothing more than a ceremony.

Utah would have finished eighth with a Rockets loss and a victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles, but the Rockets won their third in a row to finish 41-41 and earn a first-round matchup against the NBA champions, a year after losing to the Warriors in the Western Conference finals.

The Heat blew a big lead in Boston with a five-point third quarter and lost 98-88, but finished third in the East anyway when Atlanta fell to Washington. The Hawks are the No. 4 seed and will face the No. 5 Celtics, while Charlotte is seeded sixth and opens at Miami.

The other two East series were already determined headed into the last night of the season: Top-seeded Cleveland will face Detroit, while No. 2 Toronto will face seventh-seeded Indiana.

Most of the lower half of the West bracket was to be determined after Wednesday's games.

The playoffs open Saturday. Schedules were to be released by the NBA later Wednesday.
20bb02b9-7915-4286-bab4-f7d4536e7177  — Mavericks forward David Lee has left a game against San Antonio with a right foot injury and won't return.

Lee was replaced early in the second quarter in the regular-season finale Wednesday night. Dallas was already without guards J.J. Barea (right groin strain) and Devin Harris (left thumb sprain).

The Mavericks signed Lee shortly after the trading deadline in February after the 11th-year player reached a buyout agreement with Boston. He was traded the Celtics in the offseason after winning the NBA title with Golden State last season.

Dallas will open the playoffs this weekend after clinching a spot with a win at Utah on Monday.

Lee averaged 8.8 points and 7.1 rebounds in 24 games with the Mavericks before the finale.
2516e345-99f2-4b87-b50f-77e31fcdc1af  — Most of San Antonio's starters sat out the Spurs' meaningless regular-season finale at Dallas.

LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker were not in uniform Wednesday night with the Spurs set as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference when the playoffs start this weekend.

Manu Ginobili and David West also were sidelined.

Danny Green was the only regular starter in the lineup for San Antonio, which already has a franchise record in victories but started the night six games behind Golden State.

There's a chance the Spurs will see the Mavericks again in the first round if they beat Dallas and Memphis beats the Warriors, who are going for a record 73 victories.

The search begins with candidates exclusively outside the organization, the people said, meaning GM Milt Newton and coach Sam Mitchell will not be considered for the openings in the initial wave. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly disclosed its plans to find a permanent replacement for president and coach Flip Saunders, who died from Hodgkin's lymphoma in October.

Mitchell and Newton were elevated to replace Saunders, but the search will start with some big names including ESPN analyst Jeff Van Gundy, former Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau and former Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks.

The new president will make a determination on Netwon's future with the team. Mitchell said before the season finale against the Pelicans on Wednesday night that he was holding out hope to be brought back, but initial indications are that he faces extremely long odds to be retained.

d085edc8-f556-46bf-9640-868985e7b7af  — George Karl is slated to coach the season finale for the Sacramento Kings amid reports that he could be fired as soon as Thursday.

The Kings will wrap up their 10th straight season without making the playoffs Wednesday night in Houston. Multiple reports indicate that Karl will be fired after the team returns home.

Karl has a 44-67 record since taking over Sacramento in February 2015 and being handed a four-year contract. His job has been in jeopardy much of this season as he has had multiple run-ins with DeMarcus Cousins and has been unable to turn the struggling franchise's fortunes around.

Karl is the eighth coach in Sacramento since the team last went to the playoffs in 2006 under Rick Adelman. The Kings are 33-48 this season, leading to another change before the team moves into its new downtown arena next season.

The Kings have struggled for any stability, even after Vivek Ranadive bought the team from the Maloof family following the 2012-13 season and kept the franchise in Sacramento.

Mike Malone was fired 24 games into his second season as coach despite a close relationship with Cousins and some improvement on the court. Tyrone Corbin took over in December 2014 but lasted just two months before the team turned to the veteran Karl, who has the fifth most wins all-time with a record of 1,175-823 heading into the final game.

While the Kings won 30 games for the first time since 2007-08, their defense has once again been a major problem. The team has allowed a league-worst 109 points per game and given up an NBA-record 829 3-pointers.

Then there were the issues between Karl and Cousins that boiled over last month when Cousins was suspended for one game by the team for yelling at Karl during a timeout huddle.
7a782b43-459a-4cf4-804f-aad9f7df09e3  — The Milwaukee Bucks have signed a 30-year lease with the public entity that will own the team's new arena.

The Bucks will pay at least $1 million annually to rent the arena from the Wisconsin Center District. Those lease payments will total $45 million over the term of the lease. The district board approved the terms of the lease agreement Wednesday.

Construction can now begin on the $524 million arena that will be located just north of the Bucks' current home, the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Groundbreaking is set for June 18, with the arena expected to ready for the start of the 2018-19 season.

The arena will also host Marquette University basketball games, concerts and other events.

A new ownership group bought the Bucks from former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl two years ago. The NBA had said that the team would need to build a new arena or run the risk of having the franchise moved.

"Personally I know we're very proud to fulfill the commitments that we made to Sen. Kohl when we bought the team, to keep it in Milwaukee, to the people that are here," co-owner Wesley Edens said before the Bucks' season finale on Wednesday night against Indiana. "It's an amazing day."

The team will be responsible for operating, maintenance and capital repair expenses. The agreement called for the Bucks to deposit $60 million into a capital improvements fund for the arena during the term of the lease.

A public financing package approved last year covered $250 million toward arena construction, while current and former Bucks owners have already committed $250 million. The Bucks have agreed to pay for any cost overruns during construction.

The agreement also includes a non-relocation clause. Asked about a roughly $550 million penalty that the Bucks would pay if the team did move during the lease, Edens said, "I think it's fair to say we're not going anywhere ... They built it with a financial penalty that is so punitive it would be not something you would consider, so it's a firm commitment."
8a461f21-14a2-4558-b9f6-009123915d26  — The Philadelphia 76ers are set to launch a lab designed to help local startup companies at their new training complex.

The Sixers will integrate a 10,000 square-foot innovation lab at their new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

Selected startups will have the opportunity to participate in core curriculum programs, including a speaker series and leadership training featuring executives from industry-leading companies. Each of the selected companies will receive sponsorships from the Philadelphia 76ers to assist with growing their business' marketing and customer base.

The Sixers will begin accepting applications on April 15 until the deadline on Sept. 30.

Participant companies will be vetted and selected by a board of governors, including Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O'Neil.

The Sixers expect their complex to open in time for the start of the 2016-17 season.
ed2577c4-3cd7-477d-99ad-11ea38d05822  — Kyrie Irving will sit courtside along with LeBron James after all.

Irving said Wednesday night that he's "dressing but will not play" as Cleveland hosts Detroit - its first-round opponent.

Earlier, the Cavs had said Irving would sit out and then announced he would start. Coach Tyronn Lue added a mysterious wrinkle to the situation when he declined to reveal Irving's status during his pregame news conference.

"You will have to talk to Kyrie about that, please," Lue said.

Irving, who missed the start of the regular season while recovering from knee surgery, said he wanted to support his teammates and show his appreciation to Cleveland's fans.

But after discussing the situation with Lue and general manager David Griffin it was decided Irving will rest.

"We kind of made an executive decision," Irving said. "I trust them and they trust me."

James will also get another day to rest for the playoffs by sitting out the finale against the Pistons, who beat Cleveland twice during the regular season, but will enter the playoffs as a No. 8 seed.

The Cavs clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference earlier in the week and Lue is using the last game to keep James, Irving and starters Kevin Love and J.R. Smith fresh.

Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy is sitting his starters as well. The Pistons hosted Miami on Tuesday.

"I've never sat guys on the last game, but I'm not sure that I've had many with teams on a back-to-back," Van Gundy said, "and certainly not playing the team you're playing in the first round of the playoffs. It's sort of a different situation. I'm not really comfortable with the decision I made, but now that I've made it that's where we're going."

The only Cleveland starter playing is Tristan Thompson, who will be appearing in his 370th consecutive game. Lue named Thompson his starter for the postseason, moving him into the lineup ahead of center Timofey Mozgov, who has had a disappointing season.

The Cavs also signed guard Dahntay Jones for the postseason. The 6-foot-6, 11-year veteran played for Grand Rapids in the NBA Development League. A first-round pick by Boston in 2003, Jones has played in 49 career postseason games and is a solid defender.

With Iman Shumpert slowed by an injured left knee, Jones gives the Cavs another perimeter defender.

Jones is excited about joining a team with a legitimate chance at winning a title.

"I'm still the same defensive-minded individual I was many years ago," said Jones. "I had to adapt and make my niche throughout the league in that respect. I'm willing to do anything on the defensive end and help out and try to communicate and just try to be as vocal as possible."
e4d02177-a9e4-4612-a85e-9baf4646be9e  — Udonis Haslem will miss Miami's regular-season finale at Boston on Wednesday night with soreness in his left foot.

Haslem was hurt in the fourth quarter of Miami's win at Detroit on Tuesday, limping immediately to the locker room after leaving the game and not returning.

He has appeared in 37 games for the Heat this season, averaging 1.6 points.

Haslem played in each of Miami's last six games going into Wednesday, his longest streak of appearances since December. He and Dwyane Wade are the only two players to be on all three of Miami's NBA championship teams, both of them now completing their 13th season with the Heat.

Miami opens the playoffs this weekend. It's unclear if Haslem will be available.
b87f5670-f094-4ab8-8cfa-d78bfeed266f  — As Kobe Bryant makes the last stop of his storied 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, a downtown train station will be part of the citywide celebration.

The Pico Station on Metro's Blue and Expo rail lines will for a day become the Kobe Station.

The station is the Metro stop for Staples Center, the arena two blocks away where the 37-year-old Bryant will play his last game before retirement Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz.

A Metro spokesman says workers will change the signs at the station to bear Kobe's name starting at 6 a.m.
90bec63d-c914-4929-af90-7f0f48b03472  — Detroit Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson is missing a matchup with the Miami Heat because of an abdominal strain.

Miami reserve forward Justise Winslow also sat out of the possibly pivotal game Tuesday night with a sprained left ankle.

Both playoff-bound teams were trying to improve their playoff positioning.

Jackson's absence appeared to come as a surprise after he took part in warmups more about an hour before the game. Steve Blake started in Jackson's place, but the Pistons didn't expect him to really replace a player who averages a team-high 18.8 points a game.

Winslow left Miami's game on Sunday night against Orlando with a sprained ankle. He averages 6.4 points a game.
1924bba2-4cf4-4905-b83d-a209748cfaba  — Joe Smith made a blind, backward, over-the-head free throw that Stephen Curry couldn't match. Then, the Angels relief pitcher stymied the reigning NBA MVP on a left-handed 3-pointer and had suddenly beaten arguably the world's best basketball player at a good-natured game of PIG.

"That was fun. I loved it," a giddy Smith said afterward. "I'm not that bad. I ain't that good either. Sometimes a little bit of luck, a lot bit of luck."

Whether Curry brought his absolute best stuff to the post-practice contest, we'll never know. It sure made Smith's day to walk away a winner from the defending champion Golden State Warriors' practice. Smith, infielder Cliff Pennington and sluggers Albert Pujols and Mike Trout attended practice Tuesday before their night game against the Oakland Athletics some 10 minutes down the freeway at the Coliseum.

And what a day to be there, with Golden State (72-9) trying to beat the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' all-time wins record in Wednesday night's regular-season finale against Memphis at Oracle Arena.

Smith took his win in stride. He received handshakes and hugs from Curry.

"Well, you don't go into something expecting you're going to lose, that ain't how you become a professional athlete," cracked Smith. "Everything you do you want to win. But that was pretty cool. Like I told him, we positioned everybody the right way. I just got lucky, I was in front of him and there were four guys. All of his tough shots, everybody else missed. We knew somebody had to beat him. We couldn't walk out of here without a win, you know? That's not making ESPN."

Oh, and Trout topped Draymond Green in a separate game.

Curry got a kick out of having the Angels in the house.

"I've watched Albert Pujols for years and never met him before so that's pretty cool and obviously Mike Trout and the rest of the teammates, talented guys in their trade, so it's pretty cool that they'd come out and watch us practice and get to chop it up for a little bit."

But, he did say all this before losing to Smith.
e8c09a41-7ec9-492b-9268-3a988a1eb287  — The Phoenix Suns are relocating their Development League team from Bakersfield, California, to Prescott Valley, Arizona.

In making the move, the Suns purchased the Bakersfield Jam, becoming the 15th NBA team to own and operate its D-League affiliate.

The team will be known as the Northern Arizona Suns and will play their 24-game home schedule at the 5,100-seat Prescott Valley Events Center beginning in the 2016-17 season.
ba825605-40ed-48ce-89b3-7c951b5f01ab  — Thunder guard Russell Westbrook had a triple-double by halftime of Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Westbrook finished the half with 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists as the Thunder led 58-48 at the break. It was his league-leading 18th triple-double of the season, and the 37th of his career. He clinched it on an assist to Anthony Morrow for a 3-pointer with 11.9 seconds left in the second quarter.

According to STATS, which has kept track since the 2002-03 season, no player had a triple-double by halftime in a game until Westbrook's performance.

Kobe Bryant had 13 points at the break for the Lakers, all in the first quarter, in the final road game of his 20-year career.

39bdc83c-b30e-4e58-a51e-75e2c13f66db  — The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Bryce Cotton for the rest of the regular season under the NBA's hardship roster rules.

The Grizzlies announced the move Monday. They have two more games before beginning the playoffs.

Cotton has made three appearances for Memphis since signing a 10-day contract April 1. He has played a total of six games and 34 minutes with the Grizzlies and Phoenix Suns this season.

Cotton played 15 games for the Utah Jazz last season. He played in college at Providence and spent time in the NBA D-League and Chinese Basketball Association.
51b95ca7-0f54-47d2-a511-f64a3b74350a  — Like just about every fan, LeBron James is impressed by Golden State's golden run to 72 wins.

The Cavaliers' star said Monday he appreciates what the Warriors have done in matching the NBA record for regular-season wins set by Michael Jordan and the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. Golden State (72-9) can break the mark with a win Wednesday against Memphis.

"I can say that I actually got to witness some history," James said following shootaround as the Cavs prepared to play the Atlanta Hawks.

James was 11 and idolizing Jordan when he and the Bulls set a record some thought untouchable.

"I remember the '95-96 team, but I wasn't watching every game, wasn't fortunate enough to watch every game," said James, who lost twice to the Warriors this season. "So, I knew about it. I kind of watched the Bulls from afar but to actually be in the league now while they're setting this record, have the opportunity to set this record, it would be something I can talk about later in life."

The Warriors tied Chicago's hallowed record Sunday night with a 92-86 win at San Antonio, which rested All-Star center Tim Duncan. The historic win also ended Golden State's 33-game losing skid in San Antonio, a skid stretching back to 1997.

It would be understandable if James harbored some resentment toward the Warriors. After all, Golden State denied James a third league title by beating the Cavs in last year's Finals.

James, though, expressed admiration of the accomplishment.

While there has been some debate as whether Golden State has been too focused on the wins record, James feels they've handled the pursuit properly.

"I feel like they've just played their game. You can't fault anyone for winning and then say, 'Oh, they were tired because they lost late.' You don't get that opportunity if you don't win," he said. "You don't even get the opportunity to play for a championship if you don't win. ... I don't think they're worried about being tired at this point."

The Cavs, meanwhile, have their own focus this week. A win over the Hawks would clinch the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and give them home-court advantage in the playoffs. Cleveland has a two-game lead over Toronto.

James diminished the importance of Cleveland securing the top seed.

"All our importance is on continuing to play well," he said. "The No. 1 seed, the No. 2 seed, whatever the seeds, it hasn't been a focus of ours, it's just about us continuing to work our process, work our habits, and live with the results."
0dd1ce10-cbb5-4523-bc5e-e9843ad3eff2  — Cavaliers reserve guard Iman Shumpert will miss the final two games of the regular season after having his left knee drained.

One of the team's best defenders, Shumpert will undergo further treatment and rest over the next few days. The team said he expected to be ready for practice in preparation of the playoffs, which begin this weekend.

Shumpert, who averages 5.8 points and 24.4 minutes, has been dealing with injuries since he was acquired by the Cavs last season in a trade from New York. He missed the start of this season after tearing a wrist ligament.

Also, backup point guard Mo Williams will visit orthopedist Dr. James Andrews for further evaluation on his injured left knee. Williams has been slowed by the injury for several months and has made previous trips to see Andrews.

Williams was sent home from the team's recent road trip after experience more soreness.
c6e3317b-5a78-4d28-a82c-8466cdbb6fcf  Hawks vs. Cavaliers (7 ET, NBA TV)

Flying High

The Atlanta Hawks are hitting their stride at the perfect time. They ride into Cleveland on a three-game winning streak, which includes huge wins over the No. 2 seed Toronto Raptors on Thursday and the No. 4 seed Boston Celtics on Saturday. These wins gave the Hawks a 1.0 game lead over the Celtics and Miami Heat, who are tied for the No. 4 and 5 seeds with a record of 47-33. Since February 26, the Hawks have the second-best record in the league (17-5), best defensive rating (95.3) and best net rating (9.4). Atlanta has lost six straight games to the Cavaliers, so expect them to be extremely motivated tonight as they look to send a message to Cleveland before the playoffs. If the current seeding holds, Atlanta and Cleveland could meet again in the Eastern Conference finals.

Lock Up No. 1

The Cavaliers can secure the top in the Eastern Conference with a win tonight. They failed to clinch the spot against the Bulls on Saturday, which gave renewed hope to the No. 2 seed Raptors who trail by 2.0 games with two games left. The Raptors hold a 2-1 season-series lead over the Cavaliers, so Cleveland would fall to the No. 2 seed if both teams finish 56-26. You know LeBron James and the Cavaliers want this top spot locked up as soon as possible, so don't be surprised if they play with playoff intensity tonight. A loss would be the third straight defeat for Cleveland, which would tie its longest losing streak of the season.

Strong April

LeBron James and Kevin Love are finding a groove over the past two weeks of action. In April, LeBron is averaging 27.5 points on 62.2 percent shooting, 9.0 rebounds and 8.3 assists while Love is tallying 20.0 points on 45.7 percent from the field, 48.6 percent from 3-point and 8.4 rebounds. This is exactly what the Cavaliers need from these two superstars and it will be interesting to see how they perform against the Hawks' elite defense tonight. The other piece of the Cavaliers' big three, Kyrie Irving, has struggled this month with averages of 18.0 points on 38.8 percent shooting. Cleveland will need more from him when the playoffs kick off this weekend.

Kings vs. Suns (10 ET, NBA TV)

Young Gunners

Stick around after the big Hawks vs. Cavaliers game for an exciting Western Conference battle that features two of the most exciting young players in the league. Phoenix Suns rookie Devin Booker has taken full advantage of his opportunities this season with averages of 19.3 points and 4.2 assists since the All-Star break. He has six games with 30 or more points this season and will look for another tonight against a Sacramento Kings defense that allows the most points in the league. Meanwhile on Sacramento, the MVP's younger brother, Seth Curry, is starting to find some playing time with the Kings over the last few weeks. Since mid-March, Curry is averaging 15.2 points on 51.1 percent from the field, 54.3 percent from 3-point and 2.4 assists in 27.7 minutes. He hit a career-high six 3-pointers in the Kings' win on Saturday and will look to continue this hot stretch against a Suns defense that allows the second most points in the NBA.

NBA.com staff reports
813a5911-0548-4d00-a32d-45dd88086517  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

a147d075-d7e8-45e6-b38d-f54f63ff2cb0  — Draymond Green rebuked a reporter who tried to make a correlation between Golden State's playoff wins in Houston and recent flooding in the area after the Warriors' Game 4 victory on Sunday.

The reporter stumbled over the question that began with: "So Draymond, here's an interesting question."

He seemed to be trying to make a correlation between the Warriors' success against the Rockets in the playoffs and the floods this year and last year during the Western Conference finals. But before he could get to an actual question, Green cut him off.

Green said in part: "I feel sorry for the people of Houston. People are losing their homes, their cars, losing their lives, losing loved ones, and you're trying to get a controversial statement out of me about the 3s we're hitting. I know what you're getting at but you're not getting that out of me."

He went on for about a minute and seemed to get angrier as he spoke. He ended his comments with: "You keep asking me the same question about this flood. Don't ask me that no more, man. Because it ain't cool and you ain't getting the statement you want out of me."
7e178f17-8334-4195-9e9f-fc3db5193ea5  — If the Golden State Warriors want to cap a record-setting season with a second straight NBA title, they will need to survive the next two weeks without their best player.

Stephen Curry is expected to miss at least two weeks with a Grade 1 sprain of the MCL in his right knee, dealing an unexpected blow to the Warriors' hopes of repeating as champions.

"From our perspective, it's relatively good news," general manager Bob Myers said Monday. "Clearly we don't want to be here getting MRIs at this point of the season, especially someone of Steph's stature. ... But mechanically the knee is intact, so that's good."

Curry Goes Down Stephen Curry goes down with a right-knee strain as the time expires in the first half, and hobbles off of the court.

Myers said the two-week estimate is an educated guess based on how players typically respond to similar injuries, but cautioned the absence could be three weeks or possibly slightly shorter.

The team will have a better handle on how long Curry will be out after about a week but Curry will miss the rest of the first round of the playoffs and almost assuredly the start of the second round if the Warriors advance. Golden State leads Houston 3-1 heading into Game 5 at home on Wednesday night.

"If it's not two weeks, don't go crazy," Myers said. "If it's before that, great. If it's after, it's after."

Curry was injured on the final play of the first half of Sunday's 121-94 win in Houston when he slid awkwardly on a wet spot on the court and fell. He immediately grabbed his knee and jogged with a limp to the locker room.

"Nobody is to blame here," Myers said. "If you play basketball, that stuff happens unfortunately."

Curry came out with the team after halftime, but sat on the bench for most of the warmup time. After talking with coaches, he returned to the locker room with his second injury of the series. Curry had missed the previous two games with a sprained right ankle but said that was not an issue during the first half Sunday.

The Warriors thrived without Curry on Sunday, hitting eight 3-pointers in the third quarter alone to turn a tie game into a 21-point lead on the way to the easy win.

But doing that without the reigning MVP for a longer period of time figures to be more problematic. The Warriors have gone 3-2 this season without Curry playing, including wins against the Rockets on New Year's Eve and at home in Game 2. Golden State also lost Game 3 in Houston by one point while Curry sat with the ankle injury.

Replacing everything Curry does is almost impossible because no one has ever had the collection of skills he has with the ability to spread the defense with long-range shooting, the ballhandling to create his own shot and the playmaking that leads to easy baskets for his teammates.

Steph Curry Injury: Are Warriors Still Favorites? Are the Warriors good enough to overcome this injury?

Curry led the NBA this season by averaging 30.1 points per game, while averaging 6.7 assists, 5.4 rebounds and a league-leading 2.1 steals as well. Curry made a record 402 3-pointers, eclipsing his own previous mark by 116.

While backup point guard Shaun Livingston and do-everything power forward Draymond Green can shoulder much of the playmaking load and Klay Thompson is the second-best 3-point shooter in the league, the Warriors go from a historically great team that won a record 73 games in the regular season with Curry in the lineup to a vulnerable one if he misses significant time.

With a 3-1 series lead and two potential games at home against the eighth-seeded Rockets, Golden State is still primed to advance to the second round without Curry. But a second-round series against either the Los Angeles Clippers or Portland would be much more problematic.

The second round of the playoffs won't start until this weekend at the earliest. No matter when the second round starts, Game 4 would likely be either May 8 or 9, which will be in two weeks.

That would make Curry's earliest possible return in Game 5 but Golden State could be forced to go the entire round without him, which could open a path for teams like San Antonio, Oklahoma City, the Clippers or Cleveland to win the title.

The Warriors benefited from injuries to opponents last season on the way to the NBA title with Memphis point guard Mike Conley missing time in the second round and Cleveland missing point guard Kyrie Irving for the last five games and power forward Kevin Love for the entire NBA Finals.

Now Golden State is the team dealing with injuries.
f8dd3d43-1bbe-4732-a0ba-14b02b66fa12  — Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and forward Kevin Durant have each been fined for separate violations, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Westbrook has been fined $25,000 for directing inappropriate language toward a fan during the Thunder's 119-108 win over the Dallas Mavericks on April 23 at American Airlines Center.

Durant has been fined $15,000 for his Flagrant 2 foul on the Mavericks' Justin Anderson with 50.6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of the same game.
b494b5d1-34a2-449e-92f8-de7a25918563  — Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens says forward Kelly Olynyk is available for Sunday night's game against Atlanta.

Olynyk has missed the last two games of the first-round playoff series with a shoulder injury.

Stevens says he isn't sure how much Olynyk will play.

The Celtics need a win to tie the series 2-2 heading into Game 5 on Tuesday in Atlanta.
8ca502dd-bc92-48b0-a8ec-813fe7f77ba7  — Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry will play on Sunday against the Houston Rockets in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series.

Curry sprained his right ankle in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.

Curry practiced with the team the past two days, and after he went through his pregame warmup on Sunday, the Warriors announced that he would play.
c7d49a4f-7925-47f4-a44d-63408a3c7720  — A power surge that knocked out the main lights at the FedExForum wound up delaying Game 4 of the first-round series between the San Antonio Spurs and Memphis Grizzlies by 19 minutes.

JaMychal Green had just turned the ball over on an offensive foul with the Spurs heading back down the court when the main lights went out, stopping play Sunday. Both teams went back to their benches, while officials checked on the problem announced as a power surge.

Play stop with 10:02 left in the second quarter, with the Spurs up 25-23 over the Grizzlies. Both teams stayed warm by shooting until play resumed at 1:57 p.m.

San Antonio is trying to close out the best-of-seven series, which it leads 3-0.
2e85b02e-1595-42b8-9f33-81498b897e04  — Hornets forward Nicolas Batum hasn't ruled himself out for Game 4 of Charlotte's first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat on Monday night.

Batum missed Game 3 with a strained left foot. The Hornets won 96-80 on Saturday night to pull the series to 2-1.

Batum walked around at practice Sunday, his left foot heavily taped, and shot some mid-range jumpers.

Batum said the ankle has improved and some of the swelling has subsided since he injured it in Game 2. "I hope (I can play), but I really can't say yes or no," he said. "I don't know how I'm going to feel (Monday). I am doing everything I can to be back as soon as possible."

Batum is averaging 16.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists in the playoffs.

On Miami's side, center Hassan Whiteside sat out practice Sunday with a bruised right thigh as a precautionary measure. Whiteside said he took either a knee or an elbow to the thigh on a pick and roll during the fourth quarter Saturday night and that he was sore.

However, he is receiving treatment and believes he will be ready to play in Game 4.

"I'm a pretty tough guy," Whiteside said with a smile.
3f056c0f-dae7-451c-9ae8-b1c14c1775e5  — The testy first-round series between regional rivals Oklahoma City and Dallas got a little testier.

Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and Mavericks center Salah Mejri were assessed double technicals in Game 4 on Saturday night over an incident in front of the Oklahoma City bench that started when Anthony Morrow refused to give the ball to Mejri after the Thunder threw it out of bounds.

Dallas guard J.J. Barea confronted Morrow, the Oklahoma City guard and former Maverick who then shoved Barea. Westbrook and Mejri ended up nose-to-nose in a shouting match before all the players were separated by coaches and officials.

The Thunder also were given a delay-of-game warning.

Players had to be separated twice in Game 3, and Dallas coach Rick Carlisle later complained about an elbow thrown by Kevin Durant on Mejri. The NBA gave the Oklahoma City star a technical Friday, the day after the game.
04f35c66-f5e4-452d-9b28-4da4076fd0e7  — Mavericks guard Deron Williams' attempt to play through a sports hernia in Game 4 of a first-round series against Oklahoma City lasted less than 2 minutes.

Williams started Saturday night after missing Dallas' loss in Game 3. But he aggravated the injury while chasing a loose ball and running into the scorer's table just 40 seconds into the game.

The team officially listed the injury as a left abdominal strain. Williams came out of the game and went to the locker room with 10:31 left in the first quarter.

The 11-year veteran played a big role in the first half of the Mavericks' one-point win in Game 2, but he left in the third quarter and didn't return. Williams has said offseason surgery is possible.
b733a418-d802-4458-82fb-8aa56bec1457  — Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas says he hasn't been suspended for taking a swing at Atlanta's Dennis Schroder during Game 3 of their first-round playoff series.

Thomas scored a career-high 42 points in Boston's 111-103 victory Friday night. He swung his arm at Schroder in the first quarter, hitting the Hawks point guard in the side of the head.

Thomas spent a restless night before getting the word from Celtics president Danny Ainge on Saturday afternoon that he wouldn't be suspended.

The Celtics will try to even the best-of-seven series at two games apiece in Game 4 on Sunday.
a85c710f-97e3-433d-98bd-e76ebb0d63e7  — Dwyane Wade asked Chris Bosh to send him text messages during the Miami Heat's playoff trip to Charlotte, hoping his fellow All-Star would offer feedback on what he was seeing back home on television.

Bosh apparently wanted a different view.

For the first time since the All-Star break, Bosh was with the Heat for a road game Saturday - joining his teammates in Charlotte for Game 3 of their Eastern Conference first-round series against the Hornets.

"He brings a steadying influence, a leadership at all levels - even when he's not on the floor," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "That is why I always lean on him. He's like another coach. He has been through our system and sees the game through a different lens than most players. All of that helps."

Bosh was not made available for interviews.

Bosh missed the final 29 games of the regular season after a blood clot was found in his left calf during the All-Star break in Toronto. It was the second consecutive year in which his regular season came to an end because of a clot detected at All-Star time, though the situation this February was not as dire as the one he dealt with in 2015.

He has been at many home games during his absence, sometimes on the bench, sometimes watching from the team's locker room area.

"He's supportive," Wade said this week. "Obviously, he can't be out there with us. But when he's watching the games, when he's at some of the games, I asked him to give us some of his leadership. I told him, `please hit me, text me when I'm on the road, let me know what you see so I can give it to the guys.'

"This is his team still. He's just unable to play right now."

Bosh averaged 19.1 points this season. The Heat still have not definitively ruled Bosh out for the remainder of the playoffs, and other than issuing one statement saying the clot in his leg was gone Bosh has not offered any updates on his health status in more than two months.

Meanwhile, teammates have raved about what Bosh has been able to do while sidelined.

Heat center Hassan Whiteside said he gets regular tips from Bosh on how to handle certain situations. Rookie guard Josh Richardson said his second-half emergence in the Miami rotation was due in some part to time he spent studying video with Bosh. And other players revealed that an impromptu speech by Bosh to the team before this series started was one of the season's most emotional and powerful moments.

"It's hard for him not to be out there in the playoffs," Wade said. "He wants to be there. But whatever he can do, he's willing to do."
d7be6c0c-f19b-4d33-ad98-31196225dea1  — Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford says veteran Al Jefferson and rookie Frank Kaminsky will start Game 3 against the Miami Heat on Saturday night to give his lineup more height.

Marvin Williams will start at small forward for the injured Nicolas Batum, who is out with a strained left foot.

Kaminsky will step into Williams' spot at the four spot, while Jefferson will replace Cozy Zeller at center, giving the Hornets more experience on the floor.

The Hornets trail the Heat 2-0 in the first-round series.

Clifford said after watching film of the first two games - both losses at Miami - that "size has been an issue for us, particularly on the perimeter. By playing bigger hopefully we can have a better chance."
b734a1ef-82cc-4cd9-a4b8-982ce75fe982  — Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart has been fined $5,000 by the NBA for violating the league's anti-flopping rules during Game 3 of the Celtics' Conference First Round series against the Atlanta Hawks.

The incident occurred with 4:32 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Celtics 111-103 victory over the Hawks last night at TD Garden.
50a3219f-4d35-4536-af2c-60598748cb37  — Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel will start rookie forward Myles Turner on Saturday against Toronto.

Turner replaces veteran Lavoy Allen, who averaged 2.0 points and 4.3 rebounds during the first three games in the playoffs. The Raptors lead the best-of-seven series 2-1 after winning at Indiana on Thursday.

It's only the fifth time Toronto has had a lead in a series.

Turner played well off the bench in Games 1 and 3 and is averaging 11.7 points and 5.0 rebounds.

Vogel says he's making the change because Turner is producing and the Pacers have to "play the guys who are producing."

Center Ian Mahinmi also will start despite being listed as a questionable with a lower-back injury.
dbded59b-f7c1-43f3-8cae-3720a67fbfc4  — Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies is the recipient of the Joe Dumars Trophy presented to the 2015-16 NBA Sportsmanship Award winner, the NBA announced today. Conley, who previously won the award in 2013-14, joins Grant Hill (three) and Jason Kidd (two) as multiple winners since the award's inception in the 1995-96 season.

Conley (Southwest) was one of six divisional winners, joining the Toronto Raptors' Luis Scola (Atlantic), the Chicago Bulls' Pau Gasol (Central), the Portland Trail Blazers' Damian Lillard (Northwest), the Golden State Warriors' Shaun Livingston (Pacific) and 2014-15 winner Kyle Korver of the Atlanta Hawks (Southeast). The NBA will make a $10,000 donation on behalf of Conley to his charity of choice, Methodist Healthcare Foundation, with the money earmarked for the Methodist Sickle Cell Center.

Conley received 58 of 327 first-place votes and 2,209 total points from NBA players, who voted on the award for the 12th consecutive year. The six finalists were awarded 11 points for each first-place vote, nine points for each second-place vote, seven points for each third-place vote, five points for each fourth-place vote, three points for each fifth-place vote and one point for each sixth-place vote.

Each team nominated one of its players for the award. The six divisional winners from among 30 team nominees were selected by Mike Bantom, NBA Executive Vice President, Referee Operations; Kiki VanDeWeghe, NBA Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations; Roger Mason, NBPA Deputy Executive Director; and NBA Cares Ambassadors Jason Collins and Bob Lanier, a Hall of Fame center.

Besides the donation to the Methodist Healthcare Foundation for the Methodist Sickle Cell Center on behalf of Conley, the NBA will make $5,000 donations to the other five divisional winners' charities of choice: MLSE Foundation (specifically MLSE LaunchPad) for Scola; Gasol Foundation for Gasol; Self Enhancement Inc. for Lillard; Boys & Girls Club of Oakland for Livingston; and Helping Hand Rescue Mission for Korver.

The annual award reflects the ideals of sportsmanship -- ethical behavior, fair play and integrity -- in amateur and professional basketball, a key focus of the league's NBA Cares program. The trophy is named for former Detroit Pistons guard and Hall of Famer Joe Dumars, the award's first recipient, in 1995-96.

bb241f89-1c0d-493f-81e0-f12734711ef5  — Damian Lillard is taking a pragmatic approach to his shooting struggles in Portland's first two playoff games: It will pass.

Lillard has uncharacteristically hit just 13 of 39 shots from the field, or 33 percent, to open the series against the Los Angeles Clippers. Normally proficient from the perimeter, he's made just three of 13 3-point attempts.

That's a drop-off for Lilliard, who shot nearly 42 percent from the field during the regular season, and hit 37 percent of his 3s.

"I'm sure of myself, you know what I mean?" he said "Sometimes you just don't make shots, sometimes teams have good game plans, and when you do get good shots but you don't make them and it turns into a bad shooting game. It's been two games where I haven't shot well. The first game I didn't get any attempts up. Last game I came out I was trying to be aggressive and they didn't go in."

As Lillard goes, so (usually) do the Blazers. Overall, Portland shot 45 percent from the field in the regular season. The team was ranked fourth in the league from 3-point range, hitting 37 percent.

But Portland's shooting has dropped to about 37 percent overall against the Clippers, who now hold a two-game advantage going into Saturday night's Game 3 in Portland.

Lillard's backcourt teammate, C.J. McCollum, was also struggling against the Clippers, averaging 12.5 points over the first two games after averaging 20.8 points per game during the regular season.

"There's not panic about us," Lillard said. "We still believe in what we do. We've had two good defensive games, we just haven't shot the ball well. If we keep coming to work, hopefully we'll shoot that ball better and still bring that same defensive intensity and it will be a game we can win."

Of course, it's not just about cold shooting. Credit the Clippers' defense. In the 102-81 victory in Game 2 on Wednesday, Los Angeles was all over Lillard, holding him to just six baskets from the floor and no 3-pointers.

The Clippers' D got stronger as the season went along, ranked in the top 10 in the league for both points allowed and defensive efficiency. They're holding Portland to an average of just 88 points in two games.

"I think the Clippers are a good defensive team, they're very smart," Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. "But I do think that we had a lot of good looks in both games one and two that we haven't made. I'm always quick to realize that there are usually two sides of it."

Portland was the unexpected surprise of the regular season, overachieving after returning just one starter - Lillard - from the previous year.

Some of the challenges they faced early on this season could help them rebound against the Clippers - like shaky starts. Portland withstood a seven-game losing streak in November, eventually shrugging off the critics who expected the team to wither in what was considered a rebuilding year.

"We were kind of up against it and we didn't panic," Lillard said. "We didn't get away from being who we were. We just stuck with it and we kept playing and things kind of fell into place. I think we're in a similar situation now."

But the fact is that since 2008, 53 of the last 55 teams to win the first two games of an NBA playoff series have ultimately prevailed. No team has advanced after trailing 0-2 since Memphis against the Clippers in 2013.

"I've been proud all year long about how we learned and got better, and now we've got a shorter amount of time to do it," Stotts said. "But I think that's one of our strengths that we've been resilient, we've never underestimated ourselves and what we're capable of doing."

Lillard said Friday that he hasn't switched up his routine too much because of his shooting, just lingering a bit longer on the practice floor - his custom whenever he has trouble. He trusts that he's going to get his looks and that they're going to fall.

"It works out funny, you shoot more shots and it doesn't always help right away. But when you see the ball go in so much in workouts, your jumper starts to feel good, then boom, there it is," he said. "I feel like in Game 3 I'll shoot the ball a lot better."
df38ceda-53da-4e97-a4ba-eda523a9db8e  — Celtics center Kelly Olynyk will miss his second straight game with a sore right shoulder, while the Hawks remained hopeful that backup point guard Dennis Schroder would available for the Game 3 after spraining his left ankle.

Boston coach Brad Stevens said before the game Friday night that Olynyk was "feeling a little bit better" but was having some shifting issues in his shoulder and still in a fair amount of pain. He also did not participate in a pregame shoot around or walkthrough.

Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said Schroder's ankle was fine after flying from Atlanta, and that he was generally unrestricted during most of the Atlanta's morning walkthrough. Schroder injured the ankle near the end of the Hawks' Game 2 win in Atlanta.

Stevens also announced a pair of changes to his starting lineup. He said Evan Turner would start in place of Marcus Smart and that Jonas Jerebko would start for Jared Sullinger.
c1447988-d3ee-4dea-83d1-1c72dabd522d  — The NBA said Friday that Houston's James Harden should have been given an offensive foul for pushing Golden State's Andre Iguodala before his winning shot Thursday night in Game 3 of the first-round playoff series.

The Rockets trailed by a point when Harden dribbled down the court and pushed Iguodala before stepping back for the shot with 2.7 seconds left that gave Houston a 97-96 win and cut the Rockets' series deficit to 2-1.

The finding was announced in the NBA's report on the final two minutes. The report also found four other incorrect calls in the last two minutes, including the failure to call a foul on Golden State's Draymond Green when he threw Michael Beasley to the ground as Houston was inbounding the ball with a second remaining.

Game 4 of the best-of-seven series is Sunday in Houston.

ec1bb52c-264a-4225-ab1f-5161717c8a93  — Stephen Curry said Friday that he'll be very surprised if his sprained right ankle keeps him out in Game 4 of the Golden State Warriors' first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

Curry was injured in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.

Last year's MVP was on the bench for Game 2, but watched from the locker room Thursday night because he didn't bring a suit to Houston. Though he's still listed as questionable for the next game, Curry sounded pretty confident that he wouldn't be on the bench again.

"I will not be going to any suit store," Curry said asked if he'd buy a suit in case he doesn't play Sunday.

Curry played a couple of games of 3-on-3 during practice Friday to test his ankle. Physically he felt good, but all wasn't well with the star and he answered this way when asked how his explosion and change of direction was in practice.

"Awful," he said. "It was just rusty. Got to get the flow and the mechanics and stuff. When you miss that time literally not doing anything it's tough."

He was happy to be back with his teammates and feels like his work on Friday was a positive step toward playing on Sunday. Curry will participate in a 5-on-5 scrimmage on Saturday and how he feels after that will be important in deciding if he can return in Game 4.

Curry said he respects and trusts the opinions of the team doctor and the Golden State training staff, but that it's difficult to listen to them when he wants to play so badly.

"I think I can play through a little bit of discomfort and whatnot, especially in a playoff situation," he said. "They kind of have the thought if there is any ounce of instability or doubt, to be on the more cautious side."

"So any player that loves to play the game and wants to take advantage of these opportunities in the playoffs is going to push to get out there. Obviously, they have my best interest, but it's kind of hard to take that advice and sit out. It's a tough feeling."
a24b888b-cdae-48dc-ad24-07ae5fcda26d  — Memphis coach Dave Joerger said Friday that Grizzlies rookie forward Jarell Martin will be out "quite a while" with an injured left foot that has him officially out of Game 3 of their Western Conference playoff series with the San Antonio Spurs.

Joerger said before the game that Martin is devastated by this latest injury.

"My heart breaks for him," Joerger said. "He's going to be out for quite a while it sounds like. It's a tough deal, you know. He's one of the kindest, most soft-spoken, quietest, nice guys we have on the team."

The 6-foot-10 Martin was Memphis' first-round draft pick last June with the 25th pick overall. He didn't make his NBA debut until Dec. 18 after needing offseason surgery on his left foot. He played in 27 games and averaged 5.7 points and 3.2 rebounds as a rookie.

He scored five points in Game 1 and four in Game 2. San Antonio leads the best-of-seven series 2-0.

Martin joins a lengthy list of injured Grizzlies. Memphis also is missing Mike Conley (left Achilles tendinitis), Marc Gasol (right foot fracture), Jordan Adams (right knee surgery) and Brandan Wright (right medial collateral ligament sprain).

The Grizzlies also listed forward JaMychal Green as probable despite dealing with flu-like symptoms.
87601cf9-47c6-449d-b94f-98d068512191  — Kevin Durant says he's happy new Washington coach Scott Brooks is back in the NBA a year after being let go by Oklahoma City.

That doesn't mean Durant is - or isn't - heading to Washington.

When asked about the theory the Wizards hired Brooks to lure him closer to home in free agency this summer, Durant said, "I ain't really into theories. I'm focused on the Mavericks."

The Thunder star said Friday Brooks is a "great coach, someone that I really got to know and appreciate."

Brooks was hired in Oklahoma City in 2008 when the franchise moved from Seattle after Durant's rookie year. They spent seven seasons together and made five trips to the playoffs.

Oklahoma City plays Dallas in Game 4 of their first-round series Saturday night.Thu
6be06eb7-5013-49a0-8e5b-ea0df29dcab9  — The Portland Trail Blazers' CJ McCollum, who more than tripled his scoring average from the previous season, is the winner of the 2015-16 Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award, the NBA announced today. The 6-4 guard joins Kevin Duckworth (1987-88) and Zach Randolph (2003-04) as the only Trail Blazers to earn the award, which is designed to honor an up-and-coming player who has made a dramatic improvement from the previous season or seasons.

McCollum received 101 first-place votes and 559 total points from a panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. Kemba Walker of the Charlotte Hornets (seven first-place votes, 166 points) and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks (four first-place votes, 99 points) finished second and third, respectively. Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote.

McCollum averaged a career-high 20.8 points (18th in the NBA) in his third season since being selected by the Trail Blazers with the 10th pick of NBA Draft 2013 presented by State Farm. He raised his scoring average by 14 points from last season's 6.8, the largest increase (minimum 40 games each season) since Tony Campbell improved by 17 points from 1988-89 (6.2) to 1989-90 (23.2). McCollum established career highs in field goal percentage (44.8), three-point field goal percentage (41.7, eighth in the NBA), assists (4.3 apg) and rebounds (3.2 rpg), helping Portland make the playoffs for the third consecutive year.

Last season, McCollum appeared in 62 games (three starts) and averaged 15.7 minutes. He scored in double figures 18 times and reached the 20-point mark three times. This season, as one of four new starters for Portland, McCollum hit double figures in 79 of his 80 games, scored at least 20 points in 40 games and notched eight 30-point games. McCollum ranked ninth in the NBA with 197 three-pointers made, and he teamed with Damian Lillard to form the league's third-highest scoring duo (45.9 ppg).

As part of its support of the Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award, Kia Motors America (KMA) will donate a brand new Sorento CUV to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Portland Metro on McCollum's behalf. Kia will present a 2016 Sorento to the charity of choice of each of five 2015-16 year-end award winners as part of the Kia NBA Performance Awards. Following this season, Kia will have donated a total of 43 new vehicles to charitable organizations since its support of the NBA's prestigious honors began in 2008.

4a99ed4d-97a0-4ac6-bc42-ca4c25d88c20  — Charlotte Hornets forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Saturday night's Game 3 of their first-round series against the Miami Heat with a sprained left foot.

Miami leads the best-of-seven series 2-0, with the games shifting to Charlotte.

Batum underwent an MRI on Thursday. The team says Batum will continue to receive treatment and his status will be updated before Game 4 on Monday night.

Batum sustained the injury in the fourth quarter of Charlotte's Game 2 loss Wednesday night.

Batum averaged career highs of 14.9 points and 5.8 assists along with 6.1 rebounds in 35 minutes during the regular season. He's averaging 16.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists in the playoffs.
40e4f18d-a4a0-4bc4-b309-095cd5952b6c  — Golden State's Stephen Curry will miss Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Thursday night because of a sprained right ankle.

It will be the second straight game that last year's MVP has missed after he was injured in the series opener.

Coach Steve Kerr said that Curry wanted to go on Thursday, but that it was an easy decision to sit him again after they weighed the pros and cons of him playing.

"Without having done anything for four days, no conditioning, no rhythm, no actual live contact, it would have been irresponsible, I think, to put him out there," Kerr said.

Kerr said that Curry was better on Thursday and that they hope he will be able to play in Game 4 on Sunday. The team doctor, training staff and Kerr spoke with Curry after shootaround Thursday and made the decision.

"His thought was that he would be OK," Kerr said. "We just felt a lot more comfortable putting him through 3-on-3 tomorrow, probably a 5-on-5 on Saturday and really seeing if he's OK or not. It wasn't worth the risk if we had put him out there tonight and he had re-injured it."

Shaun Livingston will start in Curry's place after also starting for him in Game 3. The Warriors overcame Curry's absence to get a 115-106 victory in the first game he missed and take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Kerr said they will have a better feel for his availability for Sunday after they see how he responds to the next two days of practice.
abc178c6-5a02-4d64-90bb-d3a2e6619330  Related Content Powell: Brooks administration begins in D.C.

— Scott Brooks is on his way to Washington, the latest move made by the Wizards that could have the added benefit of enticing Kevin Durant to return home this summer.

The Wizards reached agreement with Brooks to become the team's new coach on Thursday, said two people familiar with the deal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no announcement had been made.

The sides agreed on a five-year deal, one of the people told the AP.

Brooks had a 338-207 record in seven years with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He helped develop Durant and Russell Westbrook into perennial All-Stars and led the Thunder to the NBA Finals in 2012.

He replaces Randy Wittman, whose contract option was not picked up after Washington went 41-41 and finished 10th in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards succumbed to injury and inconsistency in Wittman's final season and were among the league's most disappointing teams after reaching the second round of the playoffs the past two seasons.

The Wizards moved quickly to bring in a coach who was very much in demand, ensuring that the Houston Rockets, a team that Brooks played for during his NBA career and is still in the first round of the playoffs, never got a chance to consider him. Brooks also drew some consideration from Minnesota before the Timberwolves hired Tom Thibodeau.

Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld flew to California to meet with Brooks this week and set the wheels in motion to bring him to Washington.

Brooks fits what Grunfeld said he was looking for: a coach who can build a strong defensive team. Brooks also has another quality: A past relationship with Durant and they continue to hold a deep respect for one another.

Durant grew up in the Washington area and will be a free-agent this summer. Grunfeld has a roster full of players with contracts that expired after the season and plenty of cap space to add a player of Durant's caliber to a team led by All-Star point guard John Wall and shooting guard Bradley Beal.

But the Wizards went after Brooks for more than his relationship with Durant. Washington was seeking an accomplished and experienced coach to lead a core group of players about to enter the prime of their careers.

Brooks is a teacher who also helped Serge Ibaka solidify himself as one of the league's best defensive big men. His ability to relate to players marks a departure from Wittman, a disciplinarian who took many of his cues from his college coach, Bob Knight.

Brooks is expected to be able to interact well to Beal and Wall, who acknowledged having a shouting match with Wittman toward the end of the season. Nevertheless, Wall said he had "a great relationship" with Wittman.

Brooks was criticized in Oklahoma City when the Thunder's offense would become stagnant in the fourth quarters of playoff games as Westbrook and Durant seemed to take turns running isolation plays. Now it is Brooks' job to get the most out of another talented backcourt and help the Wizards get back to the playoffs.
73b887d1-2ef4-4866-b5d2-d1a398c3f343  — Commissioner Adam Silver believes the NBA has been "crystal clear" that the 2017 All-Star Game only stays in Charlotte if a North Carolina law goes.

Political and business leaders he's spoken with in the state believe it will, so he's holding off for now on setting any deadlines for when the NBA might act.

Silver said last week that the law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people was "problematic" for the league, but he believed dialogue was more useful than ultimatums at this point, so has continued discussions with North Carolina officials.

"The sense was that if the NBA could give us some time, they in the community of North Carolina were optimistic they would see a change in the law. They weren't guaranteeing it and I think which was why my response was the event still is 10 months from now, we don't need to make a decision yet," Silver said Thursday during a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors.

Silver On 2017 All-Star Game NBA Commissioner Adam Silver addresses the media regarding the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte.

"We've been, I think, crystal clear that we believe a change in the law is necessary for us to play in the kind of environment that we think is appropriate for a celebratory NBA event, but that we did have some time and that if the view of the people who were allied with us in terms of a change, if their view, the people on the ground in North Carolina, was that the situation would best be served by us not setting a deadline, we would not set a deadline at this time."

The North Carolina law directs transgender people to use public toilets corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also excludes LGBT people from state anti-discrimination protections, blocks local governments from expanding LGBT protections, and bars all types of workplace discrimination lawsuits from state courts.

Several entertainment acts have already canceled plans for North Carolina but Silver said last week he didn't think a warning that the NBA could pull the All-Star weekend out would send the proper message, particularly because the league still has the Charlotte Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan, playing there. The Hornets host playoff games this weekend.

All-Star weekend is scheduled for February. Silver said there is no urgency to make a decision because the league could very easily find out which arenas would take on the event if necessary.

Silver does seem ready for action, though, when it comes to Hack-a-Shaq.

Concerned with games dragging on longer than 2 1/2 hours because of parades to the line, Silver said he hopes there will be a change to the rules about intentional fouls away from the ball.

"I think it's not unanimous but there's clearly an emerging consensus both among the members of the competition committee and the owners we made a presentation to at last week's meetings that we need to address the situation," Silver said.

Silver said last year he was "on the fence" about the tactic, but another year of data has changed his opinion. Silver said when Hack-a-Shaq happens three or more times, it adds approximately 11 minutes to the length of a game. Detroit's Andre Drummond, one of the league's worst free throw shooters, was sent to the line for 16 free throws Wednesday by Cleveland - making just four - and the game took so long to finish that the second game of TNT's playoff doubleheader had to begin on NBA TV.

"Putting aside whether that's good television or not -- I don't necessarily think it is -- that from our national broadcasters' standpoint it's become a real business issue when many of our games are dramatically exceeding the 2 1/2-hour window they have set aside in their broadcast schedule," Silver said.

Senior vice president of operations Kiki VanDeWeghe said there has been "explosion" in what he calls "off-ball deliberate fouls" and noted that when it became popular against Shaquille O'Neal, it came once O'Neal caught the ball, rather than now when the player fouled is often nowhere near the play.

Silver said the use of the strategy increased by 2 1/2 times over last season. One possibility would be extending the rule used in the final 2 minutes, when an intentional foul away from the ball leads to one free throw for any player on the team and the retention of possession, throughout the game.

Silver hopes something could be presented to the owners for a vote during their July meeting. A rules change requires approval by two-thirds of them.
f78367e8-4061-4e8b-8d0a-c60ea44ee753  — Hawks guard Dennis Schroder did not practice Thursday because of an injured left ankle and remains questionable for Game 3 of the playoffs against the Boston Celtics.

Schroder was hurt in the closing minutes of Tuesday's 89-72 victory over the Celtics, which gave the Hawks a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

X-rays were negative, and Schroder accompanied the team as it left for Boston.

Coach Mike Budenholzer says Schroder is "making progress" and the team is "hopeful" he'll be able to play Friday night. If not, 35-year-old Kirk Hinrich will move into a backup role behind starting point guard Jeff Teague.

Hinrich was acquired at the trade deadline, mainly for this very scenario. He has played sparingly with the Hawks but Budenholzer says the veteran is "ready and capable."
c4a8429a-59e9-4021-a725-f00afc365f4d  — Indiana Pacers starting center Ian Mahinmi expects to play Thursday night when the Pacers and Toronto resume their first-round playoff series.

Following a morning shootaround in Indianapolis, Mahinmi told reporters that his sore back was feeling better and he would "be good to go." A few minutes later, coach Frank Vogel said Mahinmi did not participate in contact drills and was questionable for Game 3.

The recurring injury forced Mahinmi to leave Monday night's game early as the Raptors evened the best-of-seven series at 1-1.

Toronto coach Dwane Casey said Terrence Ross will be available Thursday. He went through the concussion protocol after getting knocked down in the first half Monday and complaining of a headache.
3c6d6ade-96a5-4c40-b53f-1161f947b22b  — The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Econet, a multinational, diversified telecommunications group, today announced a multiyear partnership to provide the most expansive NBA coverage ever across sub-Saharan Africa. The new deal represents the largest ever for the NBA in Africa and will include NBA content across Econet Media's TV, Internet and mobile assets, including the much anticipated Kwesé viewing platforms and its sports offering, Kwesé Sports, beginning within the 2016-17 NBA season.

As the Official Broadcaster of the NBA in sub-Saharan Africa, Econet Media will provide fans with access to more live NBA games and events than ever before, including in excess of 500 games each year. Coverage will include regular-season and playoff NBA games, NBA All-Star, the NBA Conference Finals, The NBA Finals, the NBA Draft, regular-season and playoff WNBA games, as well as original NBA TV programming including NBA Gametime, NBA Inside Stuff, NBA Action, Hardwood Classic games and more.

Econet Media will distribute NBA content in English-, French- and Portuguese-speaking countries on leading pay television platforms across sub-Saharan Africa, including Econet Media's Kwesé Sports channel, on its Internet-, mobile- and satellite-based platforms. Econet Media will supplement its distribution with significant free-to-air coverage.

In addition to live games, Econet Media will produce a slate of original NBA content to support its coverage of the NBA on Kwesé Sports and will carry the League's 24/7 dedicated channel, NBA TV, on the Kwesé TV platform.

"The NBA is a premium sports brand and shares our vision for delivering a premium sports offering across Africa," said Strive Masiyiwa, Founder and Executive Chairman of Econet. "The enthusiasm and popularity of this globally recognized sport is rapidly growing across our youthful continent, and we are committed to giving more people greater access to this exciting game across all platforms."

"Econet Media is the ideal partner to extend our reach in sub-Saharan Africa, and we are excited to welcome them to the NBA family," said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "Following the success of our first NBA game in Africa last summer, we look forward to working with Econet Media to engage and grow our fanbase across the region."

"This historic partnership will deliver the NBA to a region with more than 900 million people and reflects our commitment to partnering with leading African companies to grow basketball across the continent," said NBA Vice President & Managing Director for Africa Amadou Gallo Fall.

In addition to its television coverage, Econet Media will provide significant Internet and mobile distribution of NBA content through its operation of NBA.com/Africa. The new destination will provide fans in sub-Saharan Africa with extensive video highlights, news, stats and scores and original digital content, as well as the NBA's first ever official fantasy game in sub-Saharan Africa. Econet Media will also distribute NBA content to mobile subscribers, including daily video highlights, behind-the-scenes footage and other original content featuring NBA players and personalities.

The NBA has a long history in Africa with a record 10 African players on opening-night rosters for the 2015-16 NBA season. Through "NBA Cares," 61 places where kids and families can live, learn or play have been created in Africa, and "Basketball without Borders Africa" has been held 13 times. The league opened an African headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2010.

058b1d42-616d-438e-b2c2-fd5c7229c1bb  — The NBA is making a new play for fans in Africa by splitting with the continent's biggest sports broadcaster and teaming up with a Zimbabwean telecommunications entrepreneur who started his first business with $75.

The NBA was set to announce Thursday that it has a new multiyear deal with Econet Media to show live games and other NBA programs on Econet's pay TV, Internet and mobile platforms in sub-Saharan Africa from the 2016-17 season. The deal will offer viewers over 500 games a year, the NBA said, including the playoffs and finals. It also includes WNBA games.

It will see the NBA end its relationship with South Africa-based satellite TV broadcaster SuperSport. That contract expires at the end of this season. The NBA didn't disclose financial details or say exactly how long the Econet agreement was for.

"I can tell you this is the largest partnership in the history of the NBA in Africa," NBA vice president and managing director for Africa Amadou Gallo Fall said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press.

Econet began life as a cellphone network in Zimbabwe, where founder Strive Masiyiwa started his first company with $75. He also fought a long legal battle against the government of President Robert Mugabe to be allowed to compete against Zimbabwe's state-run telecommunications company.

Masiyiwa now has telecom and media businesses across Africa, and in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Masiyiwa's net worth was estimated to be $600 million in 2014, according to Forbes Magazine.

The partnership would likely offer Africans more affordable access to the NBA even though it would still be on Econet's new pay TV service. Distributing more content on mobile devices could also help the NBA's reach on a continent where only a few have satellite or pay TV, but millions have cellphones and other wireless devices.

"In Africa, a mobile device is the first screen for many," Fall said. "We really wanted to tap into the opportunity that space offers."

Sub-Saharan Africa, with a population of more than 900 million, is one of the last frontiers for the NBA. Basketball is popular in parts of West Africa, but is generally a minor sport for the rest.

To change that, the NBA has had an office in Johannesburg, South Africa, run by Fall since 2010. Last year, the league brought over Chris Paul, Luol Deng, the Gasol brothers and a list of other NBA stars to play an exhibition game at an arena in downtown Johannesburg, its first in Africa. It was the first of the big U.S. sports leagues to go to Africa. But to highlight the challenge, the game wasn't sold out even though it was held in a small, 4,000-seat arena.

Still, the exhibition was preceded by talk from Commissioner Adam Silver, who also made the trip, that the NBA might be ready for a pre-season and ultimately a regular-season game in Africa in the "not-too-distant future."

Without giving a timeframe, Fall said "I can guarantee you that's the plan."

Before that, the NBA needs to spread the word in Africa and try and catch up with soccer, which currently dominates the sports channels. The NBA plans to have platforms to show live games in all 54 countries in Africa within five years, Fall said.

"It's a massive continent," he said. "There's an opportunity for multiple sports to grow and prosper."
f637f59d-8bf6-408f-a51a-817d5c02fed6  — Stephen Curry's sprained right ankle is feeling better but he isn't sure if he will be able to play on Thursday night in Game 3 of Golden State's first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets.

Curry talked about his health after practicing on Wednesday when the team arrived in Houston.

"Based on how I feel right now I probably couldn't play," he said. "But tomorrow it could be different."

Based on how I feel right now I probably couldn't play. But tomorrow it could be different. – Stephen Curry

Curry missed Game 2 after he was hurt in the opener of the series. The Warriors overcame his absence to get a 115-106 victory and take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Last season's MVP said he doesn't feel like he could play right now because he isn't able to "go full speed, or game speed, I should say and have confidence in the moves I need to do."

Golden State coach Steve Kerr was encouraged by how Curry looked on Wednesday.

"You couldn't see anything today as far as a limp," he said. "So he's doing a lot better."

Curry, who led the NBA with 402 3-pointers in the regular season, made 3 after 3 on Wednesday in the portion of practice that reporters were able to view, but insisted he didn't look as good early in the workout.

"Y'all got here late," he said. "I missed (some) ... obviously I want to be healthy and not put myself in danger of having this linger or having problems down the stretch, but you want to keep the rhythm and momentum that we've built and not get rusty. So hopefully we can accomplish both."

Kerr is also concerned with that balance.

Steph Curry: Should He Sit? Is there a point in bringing back Steph during this series, or should the Warriors save him for round 2?

"It's funny because people say: `Just give him like two weeks off his ankle will be fine,"' Kerr said with a laugh. "Yeah, but what about his shooting arm? What about his handle? Players want to play. So there's always a rest versus rhythm equation in there somewhere that we have to factor in."

Curry said it's not just that he isn't able to do all the things he normally can on the court right now, but that there is some pain that accompanies his injury.

"There's a certain threshold of soreness that you can deal with, and if it kind of rolls into pain where things shut down if you get into a certain position or whatnot, that's what I want to avoid," he said.

Curry, whose 30.1 points per game in the regular season led the NBA, was impressed by the way his teammates stepped up with him sitting out in Game 2. Even though he has confidence that his teammates could perform like that again, he's itching to get back on the court.

"It's obviously a good safety net to know that we have such a deep, talented team that all those guys are capable of going out there and winning a playoff game and doing their job," he said. "It's a good thought to have, but I want to assess where I am based solely on (health). Not try to look at the circumstances."
6a28448b-f270-489f-a744-8339c090493d  — Pearl Washington once was the leading scorer in Miami Heat franchise history.

It was after one game, but technically correct nonetheless.

Washington scored a team-high 16 points in the first game the Heat ever played, a 111-91 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 5, 1988. He was with the team for only that inaugural season, yet the Heat still mourned him Wednesday after the former Syracuse University star died from brain cancer.

Washington was 52.

"Too early. Way too early," said Ron Rothstein, the coach of that first Heat team. "I wish his family the best."

Washington played in 54 games with the Heat, in what was his third and final season in the NBA. With Miami he averaged 7.6 points; in three NBA seasons with the Heat and the New Jersey Nets he averaged 8.6 points in 194 games.

"I remember watching him in high school," Rothstein said. "He dominated a game from the backcourt at both ends of the floor. He was a man among boys."

The Heat paid tribute with a moment of silence before their playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. They showed an image of Washington on the video screens throughout the arena as well as some of his NBA and Syracuse highlights - including his halfcourt shot to win a game against Boston College in 1984, the one where he ran right out of the arena afterward as fans flooded the court in celebration.

"The NBA and the Heat family is saddened by the loss," public address announcer Michael Baiamonte said.

Washington was in Miami at various times after his Heat playing days, including a trip to the team's 20-year reunion.

"He was a great guy," said Heat broadcaster Tony Fiorentino, an assistant coach on that inaugural Miami team. "Forget about basketball. He was just a great guy. He fit right in to the Heat family."

Fiorentino said he remembered seeing Washington at a camp in his high school days, where three other campers tried to knock away his dribble. Six hands kept flailing and missing, all their efforts futile against Washington.

"He was a magician with the basketball," Fiorentino said.
d96295ae-65a4-437d-b421-38d20e2f684b  — Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Wednesday that starting guard Avery Bradley is out for Boston's next two playoff games against the Hawks with a right hamstring injury and "very unlikely" to return for the remainder of the first-round series.

Stevens said Wednesday that he was still awaiting word from an MRI that Bradley underwent upon Boston's return from Atlanta. Game 3 is set for Friday in Boston.

In addition, Stevens said center Kelly Olynyk is questionable to return to action with a sore right shoulder. Olynyk sat out Game 2 after playing just 12 minutes in Game 1. The Celtics, who have now lost their last seven playoff games, struggled without him and were pushed around by a Hawks interior defense that had 15 blocks.

"I feel bad for those guys because this is the time of year where everybody wants to be healthy, everybody wants to play, everybody wants to get their crack at it," Stevens said of the mounting injuries. "We're going to do the very best with the guys that are available.

"We have a lot of good players in this room that have done a lot of good things throughout the year and we're going to need everybody that's available to be playing at their best."

The only positive news was that backup point guard Marcus Smart, who suffered bruised ribs in Game 2, will likely be able to practice on Thursday.

Boston will not only need production from him, but also from rookies Terry Rozier and R.J. Hunter, who logged 24 and 15 minutes in Game 2.

Steven said he envisions they will continue to see increased playing time with Bradley unavailable and Smart dinged up.

Celtics' point guard Isaiah Thomas said there's no time to feel sorry for themselves.

"It's frustrating, but at the end of the day there's no excuses," he said. "You gotta roll with who you got and we're confident in this group of guys. I know we have some key guys out due to injury but that means those guys gotta step up - including myself - and we all just have to put one good game together to give us some confidence."
c60724f4-bf0d-430e-9f6f-fb12c5910c70  — Indiana Pacers starting center Ian Mahinmi is ready to fight back.

Two days after a sore back forced the 6-foot-11, 262-pound French native out of Monday night's loss at Toronto, Mahinmi told reporters he intends to play Thursday night in Game 3.

"It's that time of year. You always hope to be 100 percent, but it rarely happens," Mahinmi said after Wednesday's practice. "It's one of those things where you just try to play through it."

Back trouble has been a recurring theme for Mahinmi, who missed six of his 11 games during the regular season with the same injury.

But regardless of his health, Mahinmi has struggled in this first-round series.

Foul trouble limited him to a combined total of 39 minutes in the first two games. He has six points and eight rebounds in the series. Without Mahinmi's strong defense, the Pacers have been unable to slow down Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas, who has back-to-back double-doubles and is averaging 17.0 rebounds.

The series is tied 1-1 as it shifts to Indianapolis for Games 3 and 4, and the Pacers remain hopeful that Mahinmi will be part of the solution to Toronto's strong inside game.

"We're hopeful Ian plays. If he doesn't we'll adjust," coach Frank Vogel said. "You just try to put it (the injury) out of your mind."

Vogel would not say who would move into the starting lineup if Mahinmi can't go.

All-Star Paul George joked Wednesday that he was practicing at the No. 5 spot, and Myles Turner, the 7-foot rookie who had 10 points, five rebounds and five blocks in a Game 1 victory, said he will be ready to play extended minutes if needed.

But the Pacers understand their defensive problems are not exclusively the result of Mahinmi's injury or foul trouble, and that it will take a group effort to take control of this series on their home court.

"We've got to do a better job of helping our guys down there (in the post)," George said.
68f01e0c-0a56-44ba-8802-4bc50caa5329  — The Atlanta Hawks are hopeful that backup point guard Dennis Schroder will be able to play in Game 3 against Boston after injuring his left ankle.

Schroder was hurt in the closing minutes of Tuesday night's 89-72 victory over the Celtics, which gave the Hawks a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

X-rays were negative, and Schroder has a couple of days to recover before the series resumes Friday night in Boston.

Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer says Schroder is "making good progress" and "it's nothing that's real serious."

Schroder finished ninth in balloting for the NBA's Sixth Man award, which goes to the top player off the bench. He hasn't been much of a factor against the Celtics, scoring just eight points on 3-of-12 shooting with three assists.
087eb89d-cd96-43fc-a05b-cf91080a8a32  — The Minnesota Timberwolves have hired former Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau as coach and president of basketball operations, the team announced Wednesday night.

Thibodeau was the most coveted coach on the market, and he's bringing his unparalleled intensity and hard-driving approach to a franchise that has not made the playoffs since 2004. He won nearly 65 percent of his games in five seasons with the Bulls, but was fired after last season amid speculation of a rift with general manager Gar Forman.

Landing such a big-name coach was a startling development for a Wolves franchise that has the longest-running playoff drought in the NBA and has routinely had to settle for second, third or fourth choices when jobs opened up. But team owner Glen Taylor, armed with one of the most promising young rosters in the league, turned 75 on Wednesday and doesn't want to wait around any longer for the team to become a winner.

"We are extremely excited to welcome Tom Thibodeau back to the Timberwolves," Taylor said in a statement issued by the team. "Through this process we quickly identified Tom as the best leader to shape our talented team and help them realize their full potential."

San Antonio Spurs assistant GM Scott Layden will accompany Thibodeau to Minnesota and serve as the Wolves' general manager and Thibodeau's right-hand man in the front office.

GameTime: Steve Aschburner Steve Aschburner joins the GameTime crew to discuss the Minnesota Timberwolves hiring of Tom Thibodeau as their head coach.

It's a homecoming of sorts for Thibodeau, who got his start in the NBA as an assistant for the expansion Timberwolves under Bill Musselman in 1989. He spent two years coaching the Timberwolves and often recalled those days fondly on return trips with the Bulls over the years.

The man they call Thibs is not the reflective kind. He's the ultimate grinder, a defensive mastermind that demands as much from his players as any coach in the league. He likely would have garnered interest from many of the teams looking for new coaches, including the Houston Rockets, but has decided to take over a team brimming with young talent.

"The future of the Minnesota Timberwolves has never been brighter and we are very pleased to have Tom as our basketball operations leader moving forward," Taylor said.

He will replace Flip Saunders, who was both president and coach before his death just days before the season started. Sam Mitchell coached the season with an interim label and won 29 games, 13 more than they had the previous season.

The reasons for taking the job are more than just emotional for Thibodeau. Thanks in large part to the work of Saunders and GM Milt Newton, the Timberwolves boast one of the most promising young rosters in the league.

The foundation includes second-year forward Andrew Wiggins, the No. 1 overall pick in 2014 who won the Rookie of the Year award last season after being acquired from Cleveland in a trade for Kevin Love two summers ago. Karl-Anthony Towns, the No. 1 overall pick last summer, is a shoo-in for this year's Rookie of the Year award and is considered by many in the league to be a top-20 player already.

The Wolves also have two-time slam dunk champion Zach LaVine, who emerged as a dynamic shooting guard capable of starting, veteran point guard Ricky Rubio, versatile big man Gorgui Dieng, scoring specialist Shabazz Muhammad and former Euroleague player of the year Nemanja Bjelica.

Add to that a shiny new practice facility that opened this season and renovations that are set to begin on the outdated Target Center this summer, and the Wolves job has suddenly and mind-blowingly become one of the most coveted in the league.

Saunders died from complications of Hodgkin's lymphoma just days before the season started. Taylor elevated Mitchell to the head job and gave Newton final decision-making authority on the roster.

Thibodeau was given both roles and will make the decision on whether to keep Newton in a supporting position.

Layden was the GM in New York when Thibodeau was an assistant coach under Jeff Van Gundy. Layden also served as GM in Utah during the Stockton-Malone days and will help the lifelong coach Thibodeau with the nuances and intricacies of the executive branch of the franchise.

Giving coaches final authority on the roster has become a bit of a trend in the NBA in recent seasons. Saunders had it and Stan Van Gundy demanded it from the Pistons in order to make the move from Florida to the Midwest. The Los Angeles Clippers gave Doc Rivers dual roles, as did the Atlanta Hawks with Mike Budenholzer after GM Danny Ferry was fired.

"He's a really good guy and a really good coach," Stan Van Gundy said. "And I'm really glad he's in the Western Conference."
21e4f9b3-a31e-458c-895e-ed01589e544d  — Firearms bills to allow most Oklahoma adults to openly carry guns without any training or background checks have led to a showdown in Oklahoma between supporters of expanded gun rights and the state's business community, including the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team.

The Thunder is among more than two dozen businesses, public universities and law enforcement groups that sent a letter Wednesday to Senate President Pro Tempore Brian Bingman urging him to stop the two bills, both of which are pending this week in the Senate.

The letter expressed concern that the measures could jeopardize existing gun bans by private businesses, at public colleges and universities, and at public events hosted at public parks or fairgrounds.

"Until these issues can be addressed, we ask that these measures not move forward in the Senate," the letter states.

Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association is mobilizing its members to support the proposed constitutional amendment, which if approved by the Legislature would be on the November ballot.

"This resolution would allow Oklahomans to strengthen the state constitutional protections for gun rights," said NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen. "This improved amendment would make it crystal clear that Oklahomans have the right to use a firearm for personal defense, hunting, and recreational shooting."

Mortensen says similar constitutional amendments have been enacted in Alabama, Louisiana and Missouri, but a similar measure brought up in Texas last year was derailed after opposition from the business and law enforcement communities.

Longtime University of Oklahoma President David Boren, a former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator, said an unintended consequence of the resolution could be to overturn existing gun bans at college athletic events or Thunder basketball games.

"It could, for example, possibly cause people from other teams and athletic officials to refuse to come to Oklahoma to participate in athletic contests where fans can bring guns into those contests," Boren said.

Bingman, R-Sapulpa, said members are hearing from both sides about the measures, but didn't say when or if the bills would be considered on the floor.

"The Senate has until Thursday to consider these two bills, and, until then, senators will continue to review the bills and their merits in anticipation of their consideration," Bingman said in a statement.

Under current Oklahoma law, residents wishing to carry a firearm openly or concealed in public must obtain a gun license that includes a criminal and mental health background check and some firearms training.

The bill, dubbed a "constitutional-carry" measure, would allow adults over 21 without a felony conviction to openly carry firearms without a license, training or background checks. Those who wished to carry concealed would still be required to obtain a license.

The resolution seeks a public vote on whether to amend the Oklahoma Constitution to make it more difficult for the Legislature to regulate firearms.
29d63dd1-4f8e-41f8-b59b-d7d63a709d90  — Dwayne "Pearl" Washington, who went from New York City playground wonder to Big East star for Jim Boeheim at Syracuse, has died. He was 52.

Washington died Wednesday of cancer, the university said.

Washington was not particularly fast, nor could he jump particularly high. Neither mattered - he simply excited fans with his amazing ball-handling skills, an uncanny court sense, elusiveness, and the ability to pull off unbelievable plays at the right time.

His signature move was the crossover dribble - the "shake-and-bake" - that froze defenders, then a drive to the hoop for an easy layup past the defense's big men. His play was instrumental in helping create the aura of greatness the Big East Conference had during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s.

He had been coping with medical problems since a brain tumor was first diagnosed in 1995 and recently required around-the-clock medical coverage and a wheelchair to move around.

Washington had surgery last August to address the recurrence of a brain tumor. The first tumor was benign.

Current and former players, as well as others associated with the program, rallied in support of Washington during his illness. A GoFundMe page was set up, (hash)PrayersforPearl became the slogan for Syracuse basketball, and ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas gave the movement some national exposure. During a broadcast, Bilas wore the all-orange "Pearl" warm-up shirt that Syracuse players wore on the bench in games starting in late January to pay tribute to Washington.

"My heart goes out to the family, friends and many adoring fans of Brooklyn native and Syracuse basketball legend, Pearl Washington," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted Wednesday morning.

Dwayne Alonzo Washington was born in Jan. 24, 1964, and grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, acquiring his nickname as an 8-year-old when he was compared to former NBA star Earl "the Pearl" Monroe.

Washington made his mark in a nationally televised game on Jan. 24, 1984, against Boston College.

When Martin Clark missed a free throw for the Eagles in a tie game with only seconds on the clock, Washington took an outlet pass, raced up court and swished the winning shot from beyond half court as time expired.

Exhibiting his flair for the dramatic, the 6-foot-2 Washington never stopped running after he took the shot until he made it to the locker room.

The Orange entered the top 20 the week after that memorable shot and remained there for the rest of Washington's college career. Later that winter, he set a Syracuse record with 18 assists against St. John's.

A New York City playground legend who starred at Boys and Girls High School and on playgrounds throughout the city, Washington was the most highly recruited basketball player in the country after averaging 35 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists as a senior. He committed to Syracuse in 1983 determined to make the Carrier Dome his home, left an indelible mark on Orange basketball, and ranks as one of Boeheim's most important recruits.

"I can't underscore how big a moment that was for our program," Boeheim wrote in his recent book "Color Him Orange: The Jim Boeheim Story." "I believe at that point we officially went from being an Eastern program to a national program. Everybody knew who the Pearl was."

As a freshman, Washington led the Orange to the conference tournament finals against nemesis Georgetown, but a controversial call late in the title game allowed the Hoyas to tie the game in regulation and they won in overtime.

Washington had some of his best moments in an arena he cherished - Madison Square Garden. As a junior, he had a 35-point game against St. John's and again led the Orange to the Big East finals in 1986 after a dramatic 75-73 overtime win over Georgetown in the semifinals. In the championship game against St. John's, Washington had 20 points and 14 assists but was denied a game-winner when Walter Berry blocked his layup after a court-long dash.

After losing 97-85 to Navy and David Robinson in the second round of the 1986 NCAA Tournament, Washington announced he would forgo his senior year and enter the NBA draft, the first player under Boeheim to leave school early.

Washington left an impressive trail in his wake: Big East rookie of the year, first-team Big East all three years of college, and first team All-American his junior year. He averaged 15.6 points, 6.7 assists and 2.7 rebounds and led the Orange in assists and steals in each of his three years at the school. He finished his college career as the school's all-time leader in assists and still ranks third despite playing just three years.

Washington was the 13th pick in the first round of the NBA draft and went to the New Jersey Nets. He played two seasons with New Jersey and played his final NBA season with the Miami Heat in 1988-89 after the Heat selected him in the 1988 expansion draft.

Washington's size and lack of speed were not well-suited to the fast pace of the NBA. He averaged 7.6 points and 4.2 assists for the Heat and finished his brief career with 256 steals and 733 assists in 194 games.

Syracuse retired his No. 31 jersey in 1996 and his high school followed suit earlier this month in a final tribute.
c21e956e-061c-4322-ae0b-b0e7b359e6ac  — The Sacramento Kings are starting the search for yet another head coach with three candidates who have extensive experience in the head chair.

The Kings plan to interview Vinny Del Negro, Mark Jackson and Sam Mitchell in the first wave as they look for a replacement for the fired George Karl, three people with knowledge of the process tell The Associated Press on Tuesday night. ESPN first reported the Kings' plans.

Owner Vivek Ranadive and GM Vlade Divac are expected to conduct a long, exhaustive search for the next head coach featuring numerous candidates of varying experience levels. It's all in an effort to find a stable solution at one of the most important positions in the franchise, something that has eluded Ranadive in his ownership tenure.

Since taking over in 2014, Ranadive has employed Michael Malone, Tyrone Corbin and Karl. The relationship with Karl was rocky from the start and drama engulfed the organization for most of the season.

Del Negro coached the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Clippers, going 210-184 with four trips to the playoffs in five seasons. He was fired in 2013 after his third season with the Clippers ended with a first-round playoff exit.

Jackson is a member of ESPN's top NBA broadcasting crew with Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy. He coached the Golden State Warriors for three seasons before being fired in 2014. Jackson's exit from Golden State was messy amid a clash with management, but he is credited with help laying the foundation for the team that won the championship last season under Steve Kerr and won a league record 73 games in the regular season.

Jackson spent Tuesday in Minnesota interviewing for the Timberwolves coaching job after the Wolves interviewed Van Gundy and Tom Thibodeau in previous days.

Mitchell is a former coach of the year with the Toronto Raptors and spent last season as the interim coach in Minnesota after Flip Saunders died just days before the season started. Mitchell led the Wolves to 29 wins, 13 more than in 2014-15.

Karl led Sacramento to a 33-49 record this season.
54d18dbb-a2fc-4777-97e4-0214ac94df1d  — The short-handed Boston Celtics turned in the lowest-scoring first quarter in an NBA playoff game since the league went to a shot clock in 1954, managing just seven points against the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night.

Playing without two key players, Boston made just 3 of 23 shots from the field and missed all six attempts beyond the 3-point arc.

Celtics star Isaiah Thomas went 1 of 6. Marcus Smart, starting in place of the injured Avery Bradley, missed all five of his shots. Evan Turner and Tyler Zeller each went 0 for 3. The Hawks made things especially tough from close in, blocking six shots.

According to STATS, the previous record for fewest points in an opening quarter during the shot-clock era was eight, initially set by Utah in a 1988 game against the Los Angeles Lakers and matched by Dallas in a 2010 game at San Antonio.

It was also Boston's lowest-scoring playoff quarter since the NBA was founded in 1949. The team made one playoff appearance in the league's predecessor, the Basketball Association of America (BAA), but records from that series were not available.

In addition to Bradley being out, likely for the rest of the series with a severe hamstring injury, the Celtics played without Kelly Olynyk, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury. That cost Boston two of the six players who averaged in double figures during the regular season.

It sure showed.

The Hawks matched their franchise record for the fewest points allowed in any playoff quarter. They also surrendered seven in the fourth period of a 90-64 win over the Miami Heat in 2009.

Atlanta failed to score over the final 5:28 of the period and still led 24-7.
89efa683-627b-4467-837c-4a6dbf114ee2  — German basketball star Dirk Nowitzki has been added to the long injury list for Dallas in the playoffs.

Coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday that Nowitzki bruised his right knee when he fell early in the Mavericks' 85-84 Game 2 win over Oklahoma City in a first-round playoff series that is tied 1-1.

Carlisle said he hoped the extra day off between games would boost the 7-foot German's chances of playing in Game 3 on Thursday.

"He's a great player who's been a big part of any success we've had this year," Carlisle said of his 37-year-old leading scorer. "Without him we wouldn't be in the playoffs."

Nowitzki scored 17 points on 7-of-19 shooting to help the Mavericks bounce back from a 108-70 loss in the opener.

He joins a list of players who might miss Game 3, including starting guards Deron Williams and J.J. Barea and backup forward David Lee.

Williams is dealing with a sports hernia injury that will require offseason surgery. He had an effective first half in Game 2 on Monday but left in the third quarter and didn't return. Barea (right groin strain) missed Game 2, and Lee has yet to play in the series because of a right heel injury. Lee has targeted Game 3 for his return.

Guard Devin Harris is playing with a torn ligament in his left thumb, and Carlisle said he came through Game 2 in decent shape. It's hard to say the same for the Mavericks as a whole after an improbable win that kept them in the series.

Dallas went into the series without another starter in versatile forward Chandler Parsons, who is out for the season following the second surgery on his right knee in less than a year.

"We know from a manpower standpoint we're at a pretty big disadvantage," Carlisle said. "And we know we're not going to outrun or outdunk or outskill these guys. We've got to play a working man's, grinding, highly intelligent game and hang with them."
9a93c506-e97a-4610-b730-e79182b4f465  — Stephen Curry's troublesome right ankle has no serious structural damage.

The reigning NBA MVP underwent an MRI exam on his injured right ankle Tuesday in the Bay Area, and the Golden State Warriors said nothing of concern came up on the test. Curry remained questionable for Game 3 of his team's playoff series on Thursday in Houston.

Curry missed Monday night's 115-106 victory against the Rockets at Oracle Arena after cutting short his warmup routine because his troublesome ankle was tender. He will continue to undergo treatment for the injury ahead of Thursday, and coach Steve Kerr mentioned there is ample time for Curry to try to get healthy and stay off his feet.

"We'll see how he responds the next couple of days, and if he's not right obviously being up 2-0 does give us more cushion if we decide to sit him," Kerr said after Monday's game. "But it will be based on his health, not the series score. It's really what the training staff says and what Steph says about how he's feeling."

Top-seeded Golden State leads the best-of-seven series 2-0 as it shifts to Houston for the next two matchups. The Warriors had the day off from practice Tuesday ahead of their flight to Houston on Wednesday.

The news about Curry's MRI was huge given the superstar point guard had two surgeries on that ankle in 2011-12. He averaged a league-leading 30.1 points per game this season and does so many other things to make his teammates better and set them up to score.

"When Steph goes down, that's obviously not easy to replace, so not one guy's going to come out and do what Steph does for this team," Draymond Green said. "Even if a guy comes out and gets 30, he's still not going to do what or bring what Steph brings to this team. He draws so much attention that he gets other people shots as well. ... I think we're the deepest team in the NBA."

Shaun Livingston contributed 16 points and six assists playing in Curry's place, while Klay Thompson had 34 points and five assists. Andre Iguodala, last year's Finals MVP, added 18 points with four 3-pointers and Green had 12 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists.

Yes, a couple of players even referenced that catch phrase "Strength In Numbers" that blares on those bright yellow T-shirts throughout Oracle Arena.

"Obviously when you lose the MVP you've got concern, but we believe in our depth and in our ability to win when we're down a man even if it is Steph," Kerr said. "So, very pleased with the effort. Obviously with the outcome. We had a lot of guys just step up and play extremely well."
2afbe757-567c-42e1-9c73-1099d2c2d2b1  — The Boston Celtics went into Game 2 of the NBA playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks without another key player on Tuesday night.

Seven-foot forward Kelly Olynyk was sitting out because of a sore right shoulder. He tweaked a previous injury in Game 1 and was unable to practice on Monday, watching from the bench as the Celtics went through drills at Philips Arena.

"He's been playing through a pretty good deal of pain," coach Brad Steven said during his pregame news conference.

The Celtics were already without guard Avery Bradley, who sustained a severely strained right hamstring in the opener.

Bradley will undergo an MRI on Wednesday after the team returns to Boston, but he's not expected to return in the best-of-seven series. The Hawks were on top after a 102-101 victory in Game 1.

Bradley is the Celtics' second-leading scorer and best perimeter defender. After considering several options, Stevens decided to start Marcus Smart in Game 2, leaving Evan Turner to continue coming off the bench. Younger players such as second-year forward James Young and rookie guards R.J. Hunter and Terry Rozier could get more playing time, as well.

"Marcus and Evan have both started when Avery's been out in the past," Stevens said. "It's more about being able to balance lineups and balance matchups and those types of things."

Olynyk is one of six Boston players who averaged in double figures during the regular season, scoring 10 points a game. But he managed only two points in the playoff opener after re-injuring his shoulder in the first half.

The Celtics have another 7-footer, Tyler Zeller, who didn't play in the opener but could join the rotation. Olynyk was hopeful of returning for Game 3 on Friday night, after the series shifts to Boston for the next two games.

"We're just trying to take it day by day," Olynyk said. "I felt a little bit better (Tuesday) morning, so I went to shootaround. But didn't feel quite as good when I got here (for the game). Hopefully a couple of more days of rest and we'll see how it feels Friday."

Olynyk said he's not exactly sure the nature of his injury. For now, all he can do is get treatment and hope it gets better.

"It needs rest. It needs to calm down," he said. "You can have a little pain and discomfort, but you can't play when don't have the strength to hold someone off to rebound the basketball."
c268335a-c7d2-431c-ae1f-cc08106eb349  Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who tweaked his right ankle during Saturday's Game 1 versus Houston and missed last night's Game 2 against the Rockets, underwent an MRI this afternoon in the Bay Area. The MRI did not reveal anything of concern and Curry is expected to continue treatment in preparation for Thursday's Game 3 in Houston. He is listed as questionable.

0ead3466-bd0f-4b9d-8513-aa5b179c6ab2  — The Phoenix Suns are retaining Earl Watson as head coach for next season.

Watson was named interim coach after Jeff Hornacek was fired on Feb. 1.

The team went 9-24 under Watson, finishing the season with the second-worst record in franchise history (23-59). But Watson has said he was told he would not be judged on wins and losses because of the injury-depleted roster he inherited but on other factors, including improving the team's attitude.

In a news release on Tuesday announcing the decision to keep Watson, Phoenix general manager Ryan McDonough praised the young coach's "natural leadership qualities and ability to connect with and motivate" the Suns players.

"We are excited to see what he can do with a healthy roster after having a full offseason to prepare," McDonough said.

Watson received a three-year contract.

The 36-year-old Watson, who played in the NBA for 13 seasons, is the league's youngest coach. Before this season, his only coaching experience was as an assistant for the San Antonio Spurs' Developmental League team in Austin in 2014-15.

He was hired as a Suns assistant for player development last summer and moved up to a bench coach position when Hornacek's top two assistants were fired in early January.

A second-round draft pick out of UCLA in 2001, Watson played point guard for Seattle/Oklahoma City, Memphis, Denver, Indiana, Utah and Portland.

His coaches included Hubie Brown, George Karl and Jerry Sloan and he often has mentioned inspiration meetings with John Wooden.

Before the Suns' final game of the season, Watson talked about what the organization had expected of him after he was named interim coach.

He said he was told to rehabilitate Markieff Morris' image and attitude to make him more attractive to other teams. The troublesome forward was sent to Washington at the trade deadline in a deal that landed Phoenix the Wizards' first-round draft pick.

Watson also said he was expected to develop the young players on the team, particularly Devin Booker and Alex Len, and improve the team's attitude.

"There was a lot going on but I think our staff executed everything that was asked of us to do," Watson said, "and we mixed in a little winning also."

After a 0-9 start under Watson, the Suns went 9-15, winning two of their final three games.
36613fd3-877a-48fd-b3c8-b478a2bff431  — The Phoenix Suns have reached an agreement with interim head coach Earl Watson to retain him as the 17th head coach in franchise history.

"Earl did a very good job with our team last season after taking over as interim head coach during a challenging time for the organization," said McDonough. "Earl's natural leadership qualities and his ability to connect with and motivate our players have stood out throughout his time here in Phoenix. We are excited to see what he can do with a healthy roster after having a full offseason to prepare."

First named interim head coach on Feb. 1, Watson compiled a 9-24 in 33 games after taking the reins, including wins in three of the team's final four games by averaging 115.0 points over those final four contests. The Suns ranked second in the NBA in rebounds per game after Watson took control and were one of the league's most improved defensive teams over the season's final month, allowing 5.1 fewer points per 100 possessions in the team's final 16 games than in their first 66.

Watson originally joined the Suns as an assistant coach in the summer of 2015 after working the 2014-15 season as an assistant coach with the Austin Spurs of the NBA Development League. Watson became a coach following a 13-year NBA career as a point guard in which he appeared in 878 career games with Seattle/Oklahoma City, Memphis, Denver, Indiana, Utah and Portland from 2001-2014. Watson averaged 6.4 points, 4.4 assists and 1.0 steals for his career, posting highs of 10.7 points and 6.8 assists with the SuperSonics in 2007-08. At 36 years old, Watson is currently the youngest head coach in the NBA.

Throughout his NBA career, Watson played for and learned under some of the league's most distinguished coaches, including Hubie Brown, George Karl and Jerry Sloan, in addition to signing with teams run by executives and basketball icons Jerry West and Larry Bird. One of Watson's most formational relationships was with the legendary John Wooden, whom Watson would have inspiring conversations with from when he arrived at UCLA until Wooden's passing in 2010.

Prior to being selected 40th overall in the 2001 NBA Draft, the Kansas City, Kan. native was a four-year starter at UCLA, helping guide the Bruins to three Sweet 16 appearances. Watson remains the prestigious program's all-time leader in steals and minutes played.
a4ac08c2-334b-46e8-ab50-eba747c85354  — Add star Dirk Nowitzki to the long injury list for Dallas in the playoffs.

3270270e-f257-4048-b35c-6552e1ccab35  — LeBron James has enough to handle with the young and brash Pistons. He isn't about to fight their coach, too.

James refused to fire back at loquacious Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy, who was fined $25,000 by the NBA on Monday for criticizing officials during Cleveland's Game 1 win over the Pistons. Upset with two non-calls in the first quarter, Van Gundy took advantage of a TV interview to present his case to the public that James gets preferential treatment from referees.

"LeBron is LeBron," Van Gundy told ABC. "They're not going to call offensive fouls on him. He gets to do what he wants."

Following Tuesday's practice, James said he was unaware of Van Gundy's remarks and was careful not to turn the series into any kind of personal grudge match.

"I think it's a non-issue," James said. "He's gonna say what he has to say to get an advantage for his team, but at the end of the day, the game is played in between the four lines and that's all that matters.

"Listen, I'm 31 years old, man. I don't get caught up in no shenanigans."

There is some history between James and Van Gundy. In 2009, Van Gundy coached an Orlando team that stunned Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals. James respects Van Gundy and appreciates the gamesmanship.

Van Gundy, though, wasn't the only Piston with a problem.

On Monday, Detroit's 19-year-old rookie forward Stanley Johnson said the four-time league MVP tried to throw him to the floor in the opener. Johnson said he was surprised by James' rough treatment.

"I understand he's a physical guy, but if he wants to grab me and try to throw me to the floor and you call the foul on me, I just don't understand that," Johnson said. "I've never had a person grab my jersey and try to throw me to the floor and I come up on the wrong end of things like that. That kind of woke me up a little bit. From that point on, it was like, 'It's on.' You want to foul?

"We both can go to the floor next time."

James said he couldn't remember the play Johnson was talking about and wasn't going to engage in any verbal spat with Johnson, Van Gundy or anyone.

"It's not about me versus Stan. It's about his teams versus the teams that I've been on and I'm not having an individual matchup with Stan or an individual matchup with Stanley or any other Stan they can possess," he said. "It's about getting my guys ready. That's all that matters."
bc00617a-1bed-4434-9088-426b55357c5d  — Partners in the broadcast booth, Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson are now rivals in the hunt for the Minnesota Timberwolves' coaching job.

The Timberwolves planned to meet with Jackson after interviewing Van Gundy and former Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau, a person with knowledge of the process told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly disclosed specifics of its search.

Jackson, who is currently an analyst for ESPN and ABC, has not coached in the NBA since he was fired by the Golden State Warriors in 2014 after three seasons and a 121-109 record that included two trips to the playoffs. He is credited with starting the process that helped build the Warriors into the team that new coach Steve Kerr turned into a juggernaut en route to last year's championship and a record 73 wins this season.

Jackson's exit from Golden State was a messy one as he clashed with Warriors management on the way out. He was a finalist for the Wolves job in 2009, but lost out to Kurt Rambis.

One of Jackson's strengths is that he is able to connect with players given his background as a former standout point guard himself, and his entrance into the Timberwolves race provides a semblance of balance after team owner Glen Taylor started the process with two high-profile names who never played in the league.

Thibodeau is widely considered the most coveted coach on the market. He spent five years with Bulls and helped make them an Eastern Conference contender. But his hard-driving approach never got Chicago over the top and he clashed with management as well while his Bulls teams suffered from injuries that ultimately short-circuited their run.

Jackson and Van Gundy have teamed up with play-by-play man Mike Breen to form ESPN's top NBA broadcast team.

Van Gundy coached the Knicks and Rockets before becoming an analyst, but has been out of the coaching game since 2007. Thibodeau served on his staff with the Knicks, and both have a reputation as defensive-minded coaches.

Both Thibodeau and Van Gundy would be candidates to serve as both president of basketball operations and coach, the same dual role that Flip Saunders held with the Wolves before he died in October. Sam Mitchell served on an interim basis last year as the coach and led the team to 29 wins.

The Timberwolves boast one of the most promising young rosters in the league with back-to-back No. 1 picks Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, second-year guard Zach LaVine, big man Gorgui Dieng and point guard Ricky Rubio.

Taylor is receiving guidance in the process from executive Jed Hughes and search firm Korn Ferry.
1992eee9-d228-4ba9-a7ba-ff54e81c93fb  — The Los Angeles Clippers' Jamal Crawford is the winner of the 2015-16 Kia NBA Sixth Man Award for his contributions in a reserve role, the NBA announced today. He becomes the first player to earn the honor three times. The 36-year-old Crawford also breaks his own record, set two years ago, as the oldest winner.

Crawford amassed 51 first-place votes and 341 total points from a panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. The Golden State Warriors' Andre Iguodala finished second with 288 points (33 first-place votes), and the Oklahoma City Thunder's Enes Kanter was third with 182 points (19 first-place votes).

Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. To be eligible for the award, players had to have come off the bench in more games than they started.

Crawford came off the bench in 74 of his 79 appearances and averaged 14.2 points and 2.3 assists in 26.9 minutes in all games, helping the Clippers (53-29) post their fourth straight 50-win season. He recorded 33 games with 15 or more points off the bench, third most in the NBA behind the Denver Nuggets' Will Barton (38) and the New Orleans Pelicans' Ryan Anderson (36). As a starter, Crawford scored at least 30 points in four of five games. Crawford also ranked second in the NBA in free throw percentage (90.4).

A 16-year veteran, Crawford previously won the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award in 2009-2010 with the Atlanta Hawks and in 2013-14 with the Clippers. When Crawford was honored for the first time as a Clipper, he joined Kevin McHale, Ricky Pierce and Detlef Schrempf as the only two-time winners. Crawford is the only player to win the award with multiple teams.

6b6e2bb2-8726-48fe-89c6-b1dc8e215fbe  — If teams come to the Warriors asking about interviewing top assistant Luke Walton, Golden State plans to oblige - just not while the defending champions are in the middle of a playoff series.

Coach Steve Kerr says the Warriors will grant permission for teams to interview Walton, who guided Golden State to a record 24-0 start and a 39-4 record while Kerr was on a leave of absence because of complications from two back surgeries.

But between series is the approved timing for any such meetings.

While Knicks President Phil Jackson has been in communication with Walton, Kerr insists Walton hasn't interviewed for the New York vacancy - and Walton said the same thing to the San Jose Mercury News before Monday night's Game 2 of the playoffs against Houston. Kerr said Jackson hasn't reached out to Walton specifically about the job, and would need to go through Golden State general manager Bob Myers.

Kerr says: "Friendships sometimes dictate conversation and there was some of that, but nothing to do with the job. He will always have permission. We will never hold anybody back from interviewing for a position they're interested in, but the timing has to be right and Luke's kind of busy right now."
827911fd-392b-4be8-a94d-edc64ef5596a  — Stephen Curry realized he should sit out a game if playing might risk further damage to his troublesome right ankle - even in the playoffs when he has been at his best. He already had two surgeries on the ankle during 2011-12 and wants to avoid another.

Curry was out for Game 2 of Golden State's playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Monday night after injuring the ankle two days earlier. He cut short his pregame routine after appearing to be in discomfort.

Now, Curry has until Thursday night's Game 3 in Houston to try to get healthy.

He began his extensive warmup routine before leaving the court about 5 minutes later, putting little pressure on the ankle while taking several shots.

The Warriors had waited to make a final decision on Curry's status until he tried to warm up, then made the announcement about an hour before tipoff. He didn't take part in the morning shootaround on Monday or practice on Sunday after getting hurt late in the first half of his team's Game 1 win Saturday.

"Obviously, if it's not right and at risk of further injury or whatnot, that's the only thing that I think we have to worry about," Curry said after Saturday's game. "Pain tolerance and all that stuff, I kind of know what I can deal with on the court, but you don't want anything more serious to happen favoring an ankle or whatnot."

Shaun Livingston moved into the starting lineup in Curry's place. Livingston, who left Sunday's practice with an illness, averaged 6.3 points and 3.0 assists this season.

"There's a smaller margin for error," coach Steve Kerr said of the Warriors playing without their superstar point guard.

Curry received treatment Sunday and Monday. He took the court some 90 minutes before tipoff and first went through his normal dribbling session before he started shooting.

At one point, Curry lined up to try a long jumper from the right wing but didn't release the ball and hopped in apparent pain before throwing the ball in the air, clearly frustrated. He left the court at Oracle Arena moments later.

Kerr said he and Curry had a long chat earlier in the day.

"We will definitely err on the side of caution. If he's not right, then he's not going to play," Kerr said. "It's not worth risking turning this into a long-term issue. ... We had a good conversation today before shootaround. Steph is a very rational person. He's easy to speak with. We kind of went over the different scenarios. He understands we have, first of all, his best interest at heart, his career. We know that he had surgery on that ankle four years ago. He's got a lot of basketball ahead of him. ... I do know that we have to look after his health because the competitor that he is he's going to want to play."

Curry injured the ankle when he landed awkwardly Saturday. He tried to come back in the second half before being quickly pulled by Kerr, who noticed Curry wasn't right.

"I'm preparing as if he's not going to play because you don't want to be surprised at a game-time decision," teammate Klay Thompson said earlier Monday. "So we're preparing as if he's not going to be out there."

Golden State already beat the Rockets once this season without Curry, winning 114-110 in Houston on Dec. 31. Thompson picked up much of the scoring load with 38 points that game and Andre Iguodala added 20.

"I think their small lineup is still unconventional," interim Rockets coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. "They still have guys that can shoot it and can score, and guys that move well without the ball. I think their system doesn't change. They'll still play the same way. They'll push it at you, they'll still shoot a ton of 3s. They'll continue to move. So you have to be prepared for that."

Thompson said it would take more than just him to replace Curry's league-leading 30.1 points per game and everything else he offers.

"Obviously 30 points out of the lineup, a lot of playmaking, a lot of easy buckets," Thompson said. "We just have to do it in a more meticulous way as far as moving the ball, being more patient. Without Steph in the lineup, we don't have those easy looks in transition he usually gives us. We just got to do it even more as a team now and rely heavily on our defense and get out on transition."
26fa60c3-c04f-4ba8-a550-a899b54e83a9  — Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy has been fined $25,000 for public criticism of officiating, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Van Gundy made his comments in a live television interview during the Pistons' 106-101 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 17 at Quicken Loans Arena.
c1caa988-e830-46ea-aa5f-3af510ffb07e  — NBA MVP Stephen Curry is officially listed as questionable for the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 Monday night of their playoff series against the Houston Rockets.

Curry did not take part in the morning shootaround Monday, getting treatment instead, and his status will be determined before the game.

"I'm preparing as if he's not going to play because you don't want to be surprised at a game-time decision," teammate Klay Thompson said. "So we're preparing as if he's not going to be out there."

Curry injured his right ankle when he landed awkwardly late in the first half of a 104-78 win over Houston in the series opener on Saturday. He tried to come back in the second half before being quickly pulled by coach Steve Kerr.

Golden State already beat the Rockets once this season without Curry, winning 114-110 in Houston on Dec. 31. Thompson picked up much of the scoring load with 38 points that game and Andre Iguodala added 20.

Thompson said it will take more than just him to replace Curry's league-leading 30.1 points per game and everything else he offers.

"Obviously 30 points out of the lineup, a lot of playmaking, a lot of easy buckets," Thompson said. "We just have to do it in a more meticulous way as far as moving the ball, being more patient. Without Steph in the lineup, we don't have those easy looks in transition he usually gives us. We just got to do it even more as a team now and rely heavily on our defense and get out on transition."

If Curry can't play, Shaun Livingston will start in his place. Livingston averaged 6.3 points and 3.0 assists per game this season.
cfe8efb1-d6fa-4eeb-9676-6796db225243  — The San Antonio Spurs' Kawhi Leonard, who helped the team finish with the NBA's top defense this season, is the recipient of the 2015-16 Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, the NBA announced today. Leonard, a 6-7 forward, becomes the first non-center to earn the honor in back-to-back seasons since Dennis Rodman in 1989-90 and 1990-91.

Leonard received 84 first-place votes and 547 total points from a panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. He edged the Golden State Warriors' Draymond Green, who tallied 44 first-place votes and 421 points to finish as runner-up for the second season in a row. The Miami Heat's Hassan Whiteside was third with 83 points (two first-place votes). Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote.

A first-time NBA All-Star this season, Leonard contributed to a San Antonio defense that led the NBA in points allowed (92.9 ppg) and defensive rating (96.6 points per 100 possessions). The Spurs, a franchise-record 67-15 this season, were even stingier on defense with Leonard in the game: According to NBA.com/Stats, they had a defensive rating of 94.9 when the five-year veteran was on the court and 99.2 when he wasn't -- a difference of 4.3 points per 100 possessions. Leonard also averaged 1.78 steals (12th in the NBA), 5.5 defensive rebounds and a career-high 0.99 blocks to go with career highs on offense of 21.2 points and 2.6 assists.

As part of its support of the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, Kia Motors America (KMA) will donate a brand new Sorento CUV to Children's Bereavement Center of South Texas -- which has provided grief-support programs for area children since 1997 -- on Leonard's behalf. Kia will present a 2016 Sorento to the charity of choice of each of five 2015-16 year-end award winners as part of the Kia NBA Performance Awards. Following this season, Kia will have donated a total of 43 new vehicles to charitable organizations since its support of the NBA's prestigious honors began in 2008.

c7d9fe03-a0a2-4a16-bd1a-8715ffd8f27e  — Sunday was a truly rare day in NBA history.

That's a great thing for Miami, San Antonio and Los Angeles Clippers. Not so much for Charlotte, Memphis and Portland.

Of the four games played Sunday in the NBA playoffs, three were blowouts decided by 20 points or more - Miami's 123-91 win over Charlotte, San Antonio's 106-74 win over Memphis and the Clippers' 115-95 win over Portland.

According to STATS, it was only the fourth such day in NBA playoff history and the first since May 8, 1999 (when the New York Knicks beat Miami by 20, Atlanta downed Detroit by 20 and Utah topped Sacramento by 30).

The only other times three blowouts by 20 or more occurred on the same playoff day was twice in 1985, first on April 18 (Denver beating San Antonio by 30, Detroit beating New Jersey by 20 and the Lakers downing Phoenix by 28) and again on April 28 (Boston over Detroit by 34, Denver beating San Antonio by 27 and Philadelphia downing Milwaukee by 22).

So far in these playoffs, five of the eight games were decided by at least 20 points, with Golden State rolling Houston by 26 and Oklahoma City topping Dallas by 38 on Saturday. It took 51 playoff games last season before five were decided by such a large margin.

There are three Game 2s on Monday: Indiana at Toronto, Dallas at Oklahoma City and Houston at Golden State.
72a26270-60d0-4e1c-9b2f-d18bff3c14c5  — The Dallas Mavericks are hurting in more ways than one in their backcourt.

The team said J.J. Barea will miss Monday's playoff game against the Oklahoma City Thunder with a right groin strain, and Deron Williams is doubtful with pain in his pelvis and groin. Both guards started Game 1.

Barea sat out the second half of Saturday's loss to the Thunder after aggravating the groin injury.

Williams, who missed eight of the final 11 regular-season games, said his primary issue is pain, and he will try to play. He said he will take a month off after the season ends, and if it doesn't improve, he'll consider surgery.
d3606b00-7ebe-48ec-a8a2-82e336ed5555  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

696b4137-0ee6-46d5-aaff-5884f26d6318  — Ozzie Silna, who turned a fading American Basketball Association franchise into a four-decade windfall of nearly $800 million from the NBA in what's commonly called the greatest deal in sports history, has died at age 83.

Silna's younger brother and Spirits of St. Louis co-owner Daniel Silna told The Associated Press that his brother's funeral was held Thursday. Ozzie Silna died Tuesday at a Los Angeles hospital after a brief illness, his brother said.

The two brothers made their millions without having to pay players, build arenas or hire coaches. They only had to sit back and cash the checks.

Banking on an eventual ABA-NBA merger, they bought the failing Carolina Cougars of the ABA in 1974 for about $1 million and promptly moved the team to St. Louis, then the biggest American city without a pro basketball team.

After the 1975-76 season the NBA agreed to a merger, accepting four of the six remaining teams into the league. The Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New Jersey Nets and San Antonio Spurs got in. The Kentucky Colonels, and the Spirits, did not.

As part of a concept he and attorney Donald Schupak dreamed up months earlier, Ozzie Silna negotiated to receive four-sevenths of a share of the NBA's annual TV revenue for as long as the NBA was around.

The agreement was drawn up to be as broadly defined and open-ended as possible. It worked.

At the time, it was worth about $300,000 a year. But as the NBA and its popularity grew, the annual checks grew into the tens of millions.

"You've got to be lucky in a lot of this stuff," Ozzie Silna told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview. "But you've got to see the stuff, too. If it's there, and you don't see it, you don't have a chance to get lucky."

By 2014 the brothers had netted nearly $300 million from the deal. By that time the NBA was challenging the arrangement in court.

That year they settled with the league in a deal that paid them $500 million and kept a much smaller stream of money coming in, according to the New York Times, which reported Silna's death Wednesday along with TMZ Sports.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement saying he was deeply saddened by Silna's death.

"Ozzie and his brother Dan owned the St. Louis Spirits at a time when the ABA's future was uncertain, but he loved the game and was determined to be part of professional basketball," Silver's statement said.

Born Uziel Silna in Israel in 1932, he moved to New Jersey when he was 7. He made his money in his family's textile business before buying the Spirits.

In later years, he lived in Malibu, California, where he was a tenacious fighter for environmental causes.

In the ABA, the brothers accumulated an eclectic and unpredictable talent pool that was typical of the freewheeling league - Marvin Barnes, Moses Malone, Maurice Lucas. They also gave a young Bob Costas his first play-by-play job as their announcer.

Silna downplayed the brilliance of the deal he and Schupak drew up. In fact, Silna says, the basis for it came months earlier when only seven teams - the final six and the Virginia Squires - were left standing in the ABA.

League owners figured six teams would be allowed in the NBA, and one would be left out. Silna wanted to be equitable to the owner who was excluded. He assumed it wouldn't be him.

"That's how we came up with the one-seventh" figure, he told the AP in the 2006 interview. "I thought that seventh team deserved the same benefit as the other six."

But the Squires folded, and Silna and Schupak applied the parameters they'd set up for that team to themselves. One-seventh times four - four teams were admitted to the NBA - equals four-sevenths, which is the cut the Silnas got each year.

"Some people say it's the best deal ever done," Silna said. "I just looked at it as a way of being fair."
c50834fc-ec82-4029-bbf3-37c18002e2ee  — Shaun Livingston's left leg could have been amputated nine years ago.

The knee injury he suffered while with the Clippers in 2007 was that severe. Going for a layup, Livingston's leg buckled backward, parallel to the court, when he fell in a freak accident. He screamed and writhed in agony.

Now, healthy and reliable, Livingston is making a new name for himself on the NBA's postseason stage. He has filled in admirably for the NBA's best player as Golden State moves on to the second round of the playoffs without injured MVP Stephen Curry.

Livingston scored 16 points in each of his three starts in place of Curry during Golden State's 4-1 first-round series win against the Houston Rockets.

"I think when you go through traumatic events like that, you understand," Livingston said. "Now, being in this position and playing with guys like Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Draymond (Green), All-Stars, being on this team, there was a time I was getting waived off teams that weren't winning 20 games."

Journeyman for this guy is practically an understatement. Just 30, the Warriors are already his ninth NBA team. Livingston has played in the most games of his career the past two seasons, 78 each, and emerged as a trustworthy backup to Curry when he comes off the bench with high energy and an aggressive style.

That night of Feb. 26, 2007, still fuels him. Livingston overcame long medical odds just to get back on the court, and for that he is so grateful each time he laces up his shoes for practice or game day.

Livingston tore three major ligaments in his knee - the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate and medial collateral - as well as his lateral meniscus, then required extensive surgery performed by renowned orthopedist Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Alabama.

Livingston also dislocated his knee cap and tibiofemoral joint. Though the injury could have potentially ended his career at age 21, he still believed he would play again. First he had to walk again.

After all that, the Warriors love watching him contribute in such a meaningful way as they chase a second straight championship.

"He's been huge. Not just this series, all year," Green said after Golden State eliminated Houston on Wednesday night, 114-81. "But really stepping in for Steph, and it's different. It's not the same thing that you're used to, which is so unique about it. But he's been incredible for us, always steady, somebody we know we can go to if we need a basket, and taking care of the ball and really running the offense."

Livingston's remarkable comeback inspired coach Steve Kerr this season when he was coping with his own trying ordeal, a long leave of absence following complications from two back surgeries.

"I admire Shaun Livingston. Shaun had probably the worst knee injury that I've ever seen, that anybody's ever seen in NBA history, almost had his leg amputated," Kerr said this week after being named Coach of the Year. "Think about what it took for Shaun to get back to the point where he is now, several years of rehabilitation. That inspires me, my players inspire me. ... People may forget, but if it weren't for the knee injury, Shaun was headed for a superstar career."

Livingston, drafted fourth overall by the Clippers in 2004 out of Peoria Central High in Illinois, was hit with plenty of injury hard luck well before the frightening knee blowout and had yet to even play a full NBA season because of injuries.

"Going through those experiences, it's humbling, and never getting too high or too low," Livingston said. "Just respecting the process, keeping your head down and keep grinding."

He has vowed to be aggressive and make things happen at every chance to keep Golden State's record-setting season going. The Warriors had an NBA-best 24-0 start on the way to a 73-9 record that topped the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' previous-best finish of 72-10.

Kerr was on that team. The encouraging words from the coach mean so much to Livingston.

"He's played and won championships as a player, and he's been around," Livingston said. "He's played with the greatest and been coached by the greatest. So to hear those words, it's very humbling. I'm grateful. I take it in stride, and I just try to let it fuel me."

At 6-foot-7, Livingston is a tough matchup because of his length and athletic ability.

His teammates don't want him to change a thing.

"He's been phenomenal, so we're going to need him to continue to be that way," Green said. "We're not sure how long Steph will be out, but until then Shaun will be holding it down for us. So he's been big, and we look forward to him continuing to do that."
91fde3a2-8237-4822-b2d9-87a55e333f56  — The Sacramento Kings have hired Ken Catanella as assistant general manager.

General manager Vlade Divac announced the move Thursday to add a salary cap expert to his front office. Catanella spent the past five years as director of basketball operations and assistant general manager for the Detroit Pistons. He has also worked for the league office and the Brooklyn Nets.

Catanella will function as the organization's salary cap specialist and support Divac with personnel decisions and day-to-day management of the basketball operations department. He will also assist with the team's statistical and analytical systems.
b7663e1c-d0dc-4dd8-b6a8-bff713ac8cf4  — The Charlotte Hornets say backup center Spencer Hawes will miss the remainder of their first-round series against the Miami Heat with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.

The Hornets lead the series 3-2. Game 6 is Friday night.

The team says Hawes will be re-evaluated in a week, which means he wouldn't be available if the series goes to a seventh and deciding game on Sunday. He was injured during Charlotte's win in Game 5 Thursday night in Miami.

The 7-foot Hawes has appeared in five playoff games for Charlotte and is averaging 3.6 points and 3.2 rebounds in 10.6 minutes.
2e33d736-f24c-48f5-8279-f7e07aacb438  — The NBA says Dwyane Wade was not fouled on Miami's final offensive play of the Heat loss to Charlotte in Game 5 of the teams' Eastern Conference first-round series.

Wade thought he was fouled with 2.6 seconds left as he tried to tie the game while being defended by the Hornets' Cody Zeller and Courtney Lee. No call came, and the Heat lost 90-88.

Miami trails the series 3-2, going into Game 6 at Charlotte on Friday.

The league's review of events in the last 2 minutes of play also states the Heat did not foul Zeller on an inbounds play in the final seconds, another call Miami wanted before time expired.
a6a0f5e2-e538-4f82-82a1-6bd7b4a60985  — Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue would like to see his former boss, David Blatt, get another NBA job.

Blatt was fired in January despite a 30-11 record and replaced by Lue, who guided Cleveland to the top seed in the Eastern Conference.

On Wednesday, Blatt interviewed with the New York Knicks, a person with knowledge of the meeting told The Associated Press.

"He definitely deserves another chance," Lue said. "I thought Coach Blatt did a great and phenomenal job here. He taught me a lot. Just being friends with him and getting a chance to understand him was great for me. I know a lot of guys around here, we talked about it the other day, they miss him and his presence.

"Hopefully, he gets another job in this league because he deserves it."

Blatt led the Cavs to the finals in his first season.
03c95185-33c3-4be3-8fbd-112061b1a539  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."

e74c2004-724a-4ba0-997f-51fd000c84b9  — The Los Angeles Lakers received permission from the Warriors to interview top assistant Luke Walton for their coaching vacancy.

Golden State coach Steve Kerr said Wednesday before Game 5 of the playoffs against Houston that Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak contacted Warriors GM Bob Myers, who said Walton could interview once the first-round series is done. The Warriors held a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series going into Wednesday.

"Mitch has called Bob and we've told Mitch he's perfectly welcome to talk to Luke as soon as this series is over and we have a little break," Kerr said.

The 36-year-old Walton, who won two championships during his nine seasons playing for the Lakers, guided defending champion Golden State to a record 24-0 start this season while filling in for Kerr when the coach was on a leave of absence following complications from two back surgeries. Overall, Walton was 39-4 while Kerr was out, and he finished eighth in Coach of the Year voting.

"It is impressive for an assistant coach. I think he should have been higher," Golden State power forward Draymond Green said.

Walton has not wanted to become a distraction during Golden State's quest for a second straight title when it comes to speaking about his own coaching future. For months, he has been considered a strong candidate to be in the Lakers' plans if they made a change.

Los Angeles fired Byron Scott on Sunday night.

Scott coached the two worst seasons in the 16-time NBA champion franchise's history, going 38-126. In Kobe Bryant's disappointing farewell season, the Lakers finished with the NBA's second-worst record at 17-65 this season, losing four more games than in their previous franchise-worst season in 2014-15.

Walton quickly earned the trust and respect of the Warriors players - not to mention Kerr, who promoted him to the top assistant chair this season after Alvin Gentry departed to coach New Orleans.

At Kerr's Tuesday press conference for NBA Coach of the Year, Myers looked at Walton and said, "This guy deserves a lot of credit, too."
680c3de3-1995-4169-8b4f-f72f3caeb0d3  — The New York Knicks have interviewed former Cleveland coach David Blatt for their head coaching position, a person with knowledge of the details said Wednesday.

Knicks President of Basketball Operations Phil Jackson met with Blatt this week, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the coaching search are private.

Blatt's interview was first reported by Yahoo Sports.

Blatt was fired by the Cavaliers after leading them to the NBA Finals last year in his first season and a 30-11 record this season. The longtime successful international coach was a teammate at Princeton with Knicks general manager Steve Mills.

The Cavaliers led the Eastern Conference when they fired Blatt and promoted Tyronn Lue to coach.

Kurt Rambis finished the season as Knicks interim coach after Jackson fired Derek Fisher in February. Jackson has said his preference is to hire someone he knows, naming Rambis as the only person who would definitely get an interview.

Rambis was only 9-19 as the Knicks faltered to the finish after a solid start. But he is close with Jackson, whom he worked under in Los Angeles, and runs the triangle offense that Jackson utilized while winning an NBA-record 11 championships as a coach.

Jackson also spoke recently with Golden State assistant Luke Walton, one of his former players, but Warriors coach Steve Kerr stressed that it wasn't an interview.

Jackson said after the season he had no timetable for a decision, saying it could be May or it could be July.
1e73d4af-23ac-4acc-83b6-0981e318cb50  — Clippers coach Doc Rivers' eyes welled with tears and he became choked up before his team played Portland in Game 5 of their first-round series.

During his pregame availability Wednesday night, Rivers was asked who he leans on to get through after losing injured stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul.

Rivers responded, "I don't know," and his dark eyes filled with tears. He paused and put his hand to his face in an attempt to keep any liquid from spilling out. He told the media that his emotional reaction wasn't in response to the reporter's question.

The 54-year-old coach mentioned his late mother, Bettye Rivers, saying, "That would have been a person."

She died last June in Maywood, Illinois, the Chicago suburb where Rivers grew up and starred at Proviso East High School.

Rivers stared straight ahead in the quiet room before getting up and walking out.

The Clippers and Trail Blazers are tied 2-2. Griffin is out for the season after aggravating a quadriceps injury, while Paul broke his hand in Game 4 on Monday.

Back in 2008, Rivers had guided the Boston Celtics within a game of the NBA championship when he had a similar emotional reaction involving his father. He choked back tears thinking of Grady Rivers, who died during that season. The Celtics clinched their 17th title two days later by beating the Lakers on Father's Day.

Grady Rivers had juggled his schedule as a Chicago police lieutenant so he could watch his son's games. He had coached his son's baseball team and he watched him became a prep star who went on to college success at Marquette before playing in the NBA.

At the time, Doc Rivers said his father was a tough subject for him to discuss. He hadn't had time to reflect on his father's death during that season, but he said he thought about him often.

Rivers and his wife, Kris, have two grown sons and a daughter who frequently attend Clippers' games. Their other son, Austin, plays for the Clippers; he is the first player in NBA history to play for his father.
a0418226-fbe6-450a-a55d-17dfbe1423c7  — Celtics coach Brad Stevens says that all signs point toward Isaiah Thomas being able to play in Game 6 against the Hawks.

Stevens said Wednesday that he'd gotten all positive updates on the All-Star guard's status, who limped to the locker room with a mild left ankle sprain in the closing minutes of Tuesday's 110-83 loss in Atlanta. Stevens said Thomas didn't experience much swelling and "he feels good." Boston hosts Atlanta Thursday night.

Thomas averaged 35 points in two victories at Boston that evened the series, but managed only seven points Tuesday as the Hawks took a 3-2 series lead.

Stevens says it's still unlikely that Avery Bradley will be able to return this series after sitting out his fourth straight game with a strained right hamstring.

He said Bradley did do some jogging recently, but experienced some soreness afterward.
09f99a0a-e6a6-4062-aa8f-1806935ac0d3  — New Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks was surprised it took so long to get the question. Almost 15 minutes into his introductory news conference he was asked, "Let's get this out of the way: Are you going to bring Kevin Durant here?"

Brooks was prepared. His preexisting relationship with Durant during their time with the Oklahoma City Thunder generated plenty of questions about the Washington-area native returning home as a free agent, but Brooks didn't take the bait.

"I'm excited about the team, guys," Brooks said with a smile. "We have a great group of guys. I understand the question. But I'm excited about the group of guys we have here. When this season ended, when I was looking around, I knew that this is the place I wanted to be."

Brooks and the Wizards can't make any promises about landing Durant, who will be one of the highest-profile free agents this offseason. But with oodles of salary-cap space and three-time All-Star John Wall already in place as enticing selling points, adding Brooks and his reputation as a popular coach doesn't hurt.

Owner Ted Leonsis said Brooks is "a players' coach in the new NBA." His hiring is another step in the Wizards' process.

"We've been planning over a five-year arc on building around young players and then having cap space so that we could add to the team," Leonsis said. "But they're free agents, and I underline free. Players can play wherever they want. They've earned that right. It's up to us, especially in ownership, to create an environment, to create a destination to have a situation where players want to come and play."

Brooks is a significant piece of the plan. He took the Thunder to the Finals in 2012 and put up a .620 winning percentage over seven seasons with Oklahoma City.

General manager Ernie Grunfeld singled out Brooks' ability to develop young players when explaining why the 50-year-old was Washington's top candidate. Beyond Wall and 22-year-old backcourt mate Bradley Beal, the Wizards have 20-year Kelly Oubre Jr. and 22-year-old Otto Porter they hope to develop.

But after missing the playoffs in the final season under Randy Wittman, the Wizards also need Brooks to win; Leonsis pegged making it back to the postseason as a necessary step in 2016-17. With or without Durant, getting there requires a mix of on- and off-court adjustments.

On the court, the Wizards want to be better defensively, and Brooks has already set his sights on getting their defensive shooting percentage "down to a respectable number" from .462 last season.

"I believe in two-way basketball teams," Brooks said. "It's going to take time and commitment. Scoring's fun, but it's hard to win night in and night out on a consistent level against competitive teams if you're just thinking about playing one end of the floor."

Off the court, it's up to Brooks to keep the Wizards together and on the same page. He isn't worried about the spats players had with each other or with Wittman late in the season. Brooks is focused on getting to know the players.

"When you have a competitive group, every day is not going to be pie in the sky," Brooks said. "You're going to have some heated discussions from me, from each other, but there has to be a level of respect and you can't cross that line and players will understand that because that's important."

It's especially important with Wall, the face of the franchise. Brooks was a point guard during his 10-year NBA career and expects to have a "connection" with Wall, who he believes can get better.

"He has another level - maybe two or three more levels," Brooks said. "We won't agree on everything, but John and the rest of the guys will understand one thing: that we will find the best way to move forward on all situations."
d3ddad89-dcd3-4f8a-866b-709a77f74564  — Kyrie Irving's freakish knee injury in the NBA Finals last year taught him a valuable lesson about what it takes to get through a postseason.

"A lot of luck," he said.

One year after medical misfortune sabotaged their title hopes, the Cavaliers, unlike the Golden State Warriors, are relatively healthy as they wait to find out if they'll play Boston or Atlanta in the second round. Cleveland came out of its first-round sweep of Detroit in good shape, and the Cavs should be close to 100 percent when they open their series against either the Celtics of Hawks next week.

On Wednesday, the Cavs practiced for the first time since purging the youthful Pistons, who lacked the muscle and mettle to beat the defending Eastern Conference champions. Following their workout, LeBron James and the Cavs stretched as a group and Irving stayed on the floor afterward to get in some extra outside shooting and free throws.

Guard J.R. Smith, who made 17 3-pointers against the Pistons, did not practice after hurting his groin during the first half of Sunday's Game 4 win but Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said the injury is not serious.

All of the Cavs should benefit from the eight-day break between games, but Lue said it's vital to manage the time wisely.

"We played very well and now just having to try to gauge between the two of not doing too much but making sure we do enough," said Lue, who made some sound decisions in his first playoff series.

And while they wait for the Hawks or Celtics, the Cavs, who had breaks of eight and nine days during the postseason last year, are keeping an eye on all the series still going on while counting their blessings for emerging from a physical, four-game series intact.

They weren't so fortunate a year ago in the first round, when Kevin Love dislocated his left shoulder, an injury that became more devastating when Irving shattered his kneecap in Game 2 of the Finals.

Cavaliers Sweep Pistons From First Round LeBron James and Kyrie Irving lead the Cavaliers past the Pistons in the first round.

Because he and the Cavs have experienced that postseason pain, Irving has empathy for the injuries sustained by Warriors superstar Stephen Curry and Los Angeles All-Star guard Chris Paul. Curry is expected to miss at least two weeks with a sprained right knee while Paul broke his right hand and could miss the rest of the postseason along with Clippers forward Blake Griffin, who is done because of a leg injury.

"I'm watching TV and I'm seeing CP come out and you could tell he's really frustrated, and Steph goes down on a freakish play that could have happened to anyone," Irving said. "Definitely you've got to empathize with those guys. But at the end of the day they still have other guys in that locker room that have to pick up the pieces and they have to figure it out. It's just part of the playoffs."

It's the part that can't be planned for, but the Cavs aren't viewing those injuries as giving them any clearer path to a championship.

They know too much can happen.

But following a sometimes worrying and inconsistent regular season, the Cavs are meshing better than they have in months. Lue has been encouraged by the play of Cleveland's Big 3 - James, Irving and Kevin Love - who combined to average 69.1 points against the Pistons, and how his team is communicating and bonding. The Cavs are connected.

"We're coming together at the right time," Lue said. "It's great to feel that way. We mentioned it in a couple of the press conferences: we never hung our head. We fought through adversity. We were down three or four times in those games and guys just kept playing. We never wavered. We just stuck with it.

"That's what you like to see. Everyone's enjoying it in the moment. We're in a great place right now."

Lue also knows a rolled ankle or slip on a wet spot can change everything.

"The most important thing in the playoffs is staying healthy," he said. "The level of intensity picks up. Guys are playing harder, competing harder. Guys are playing more minutes now. Injuries are always very important. If you can get through that first series, which was a tough and physical series for us, with no one being injured, it's good for us."
deddf331-f7dc-469f-943c-a967ce0fdad6  — Guard Wayne Ellington of the Brooklyn Nets has won the 2015-16 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award as selected by the Professional Basketball Writers Association (PBWA). The honor, named after the NBA's second commissioner, is presented annually by the PBWA to the player, coach or athletic trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community.

The other finalists for the award were guard George Hill of the Indiana Pacers, forward LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, guard Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers and guard John Wall of the Washington Wizards.

After his father, Wayne Ellington Sr., was shot to death on Nov. 9, 2014, in Philadelphia, Ellington, a native of Wynnewood, Pa., decided to channel his grief into action by becoming an advocate for gun-violence prevention.

On Sept. 21, 2015, Ellington was the featured speaker at Peace Day Philly's "March for Peace" before a crowd of mostly schoolchildren, many of whom lost a loved one to gun violence. His speech was a primary attraction at the fifth annual Peace Day Philly, which was the culmination of a weeklong series of peace-oriented events. Also in September, Ellington joined Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas and other current and former NBA players to help run the fourth annual Chicago Peace League Basketball Tournament, which aims to reduce gang violence in the city.

Ellington has continued his outreach efforts by creating the "Power of W.E." campaign. In addition to filming a PSA for one of the only hospital-based violence-prevention programs of its kind in the country (in conjunction with Temple University), Ellington plans to host the Philadelphia Peace Games in August. For that event, rival gang members in Philadelphia will come together for a basketball game played on a court built and customized with Power of W.E. messaging for community use.

"Wayne Ellington's efforts to curb gun violence are inspiring," said PBWA President Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel. "His message resonates."

Ellington also connected with The Rens, a grassroots children's basketball program in New York City. The Rens became the first basketball team in the country at any level to wear orange patches on their jerseys as a statement against the crisis of gun violence after multiple incidents of gun violence involving the team's members. Ellington provided them with tickets to attend two Nets games. Through the Brooklyn Nets Assist program, Ellington also donated more than 2,000 tickets this season to various youth basketball programs, non-profit organizations and schools throughout New York City.

The PBWA is composed of approximately 175 writers and editors who cover the NBA on a regular basis for newspapers, online outlets and magazines.

c94f0ec1-93b2-424b-88b2-26adda362cc2  — Michael Jordan reiterated that the Charlotte Hornets are opposed to House Bill 2, which was recently passed in North Carolina and could prevent the NBA All-Star Game from coming to Charlotte.

Jordan said in a statement Tuesday to the Charlotte Observer that the Hornets "are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment."

Some consider the law discriminatory toward the LGBT community.

"As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events at Time Warner Cable Arena," Jordan said in the statement.

Commissioner Adam Silver said the NBA believes a change in the law is necessary to bring All-Star weekend to Charlotte next February.
ac8887f2-99d4-46c5-88fc-9b8609aae8a2  — As Steve Kerr tried to cope with the headaches, nausea, pain and other concerning symptoms, there were times he wondered whether he would even come back to coach the Golden State Warriors this season, whether he even should return to the bench if not 100 percent healthy.

Complications from two back surgeries had sidelined him for the defending champions' record start, then Kerr found his way into the huddle again on Jan. 22 after a nearly four-month leave of absence. And on Tuesday, he earned NBA Coach of the Year honors for his Warriors' record 73-win season that topped the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls team he played for that went 72-10.

"There were moments I didn't know if I would get back at all this season," Kerr said as Golden State prepared for Wednesday's playoff Game 5 against Houston. "I'm really thankful I improved to the point where I could coach. Coaching has actually helped considerably as I've continued to heal. I sort of had to just take a leap of faith. If I was going to wait until I felt great I would have been waiting all season."

Kerr Accepts Coach of the Year Award Warriors' coach Steve Kerr thanks his team and the organization after being named the 2016 Coach of the Year.

As Kerr's news conference was about to begin, in walked his coach from Palisades High, Jerry Marvin, and then former Arizona coach Lute Olson. Kerr was stunned.

Warriors general manager Bob Myers broke down as he discussed Kerr's triumph this season. The GM called daily to check on Kerr during his ordeal.

"I don't think everybody quite knows what, Steve, you've had to go through this year," Myers said, fighting back tears. "You deserve this award. You don't deserve it for winning, in my opinion, 73 games. You deserve it for coming to work every day with how you had to feel. No one quite understands that except for the people you go to work with every day. I just admire your courage, I admire you as a person, and when we hired you, a lot of people, and they're right, said, `You guys found a great coach,' and we did. But I found a great friend. I love going to work with you every day. I hope you are here as long as you want to be here."

Kerr received 64 first-place votes from the panel of 130 media members who regularly cover the league. Portland's Terry Stotts was second. San Antonio's Gregg Popovich was third.

While Kerr missed the Warriors' first 43 games this season as he recovered, top assistant Luke Walton led Golden State to a 24-0 start and 39-4 mark.

"It lasted longer than any of us thought or hoped," said Walton, who recalled Kerr's constant reminders of, "We have really good players out there, we're going to be just fine."

Kerr's players saw their coach struggle through the physical challenges. He still spoke to the team before games even if he then went behind the scenes to watch.

"We saw it every day. The time that he's been back, he's had good days, bad days," small forward Harrison Barnes said. "You can kind of tell where he's still a little fatigued and having headaches. He's been fighting through it and he's been great for us."

Inside the NBA: Rockets-Warriors Game 5 Look Ahead The Inside crew look ahead to the Rockets-Warriors Game 5 and react to coach Steve Kerr winning Coach of the Year.

Kerr couldn't wait to return, but he had to be patient and pick the right time so he was confident in finishing out the season.

"When I came back, I just said, 'It's just time, I have to do it,' and fortunately it worked out," Kerr said. "Coaching and the involvement every day helped the process, helped me get better and better as I went. I'm still not all the way there. I still have some pain, but I'm happy I'm with my guys."

Voters took notice of Walton's work as well, and he finished tied for eighth in the balloting.

"I think he should have been higher," Golden State power forward Draymond Green said.

Myers mentioned all the credit Walton deserves, then joked to Kerr, "Can you give him like a shoe from the trophy?"

To which Kerr cracked, "One Van?"

For Kerr, his award goes to everyone involved and "is about is what we've built, what we've all built."

"This was the hardest year of my life, not even close," said the 50-year-old Kerr, joined by his wife, Margot, and two grown children, Nick and Maddy. "Incredibly lucky to have this amazing family and all these beautiful people around me."
3ce14f5f-5b36-4124-a3d8-1b4d7fb8ef8b  — Draymond Green is going to tell it like it is, and he insists these Golden State Warriors have few issues when it comes to confidence.

Even playing without injured superstar Stephen Curry.

"We're still very confident. If I sat here and told you our confidence level is the same without Steph, that's a lie," Green said after Tuesday's practice. "I think our confidence level with Steph is through the roof. It's beyond high. Without Steph, it's still out the roof. We're not losing much confidence. We still believe in ourselves. We still think it's very possible for us to make a run. We're going to hold it down `til he gets back."

Sure, losing Curry for likely two weeks or more is a significant blow to the defending champions. It stings to see the NBA's MVP go down in the middle of the playoffs after a record-setting regular season in which he became the first player to make 400 3-pointers.

"The great thing with Steph is I think he's got perspective built in just from his family," newly crowned NBA Coach of the Year Steve Kerr said. "He knows what's important. His health is extremely important but in the grand scheme of things, he's healthy, he's happy, he's got a great wife and kids and family. He's probably going to be back playing basketball in a few weeks. It's just a little bump in the road."

We're not losing much confidence. We still believe in ourselves. We still think it's very possible for us to make a run. We're going to hold it down `til he gets back. – Golden State's Draymond Green

An MRI exam on Curry's injured right knee Monday showed a Grade 1 sprain of the MCL. Warriors general manager Bob Myers is estimating at least two weeks for the recovery period, but that's merely a guess at this stage.

"His spirits are high. He's good," Green said of Curry. "It seems like he's moving a little better than he was yesterday."

Kerr reminded his team during film study Tuesday that "there's no guarantee of anything," using injuries to the Clippers' Chris Paul and Blake Griffin as examples.

At a minimum, Golden State would likely be without Curry - and his 30.1 scoring average - for the initial four games of the second round if the Warriors advance. They play Game 5 of their best-of-seven series with Houston on Wednesday night at Oracle Arena leading 3-1.

"I just feel bad for Steph more than anything," Kerr said. "He's worked so hard and now all of a sudden after really several years of being injury-free, back-to-back injuries. But in a lot of ways, he's lucky. He's lucky it's not worse and if we can take care of business while he's getting better, there's a chance he can come back and be part of this playoff run and help us go deep. We'll try to hold down the fort while he's out. ... He's obviously not playing any time soon."

The Warriors won Sunday's Game 4 at Houston after Curry injured his knee when he slipped awkwardly on the final play of the first half and his legs split apart. Golden State hit eight 3-pointers in the third quarter alone to turn a tie game into a 21-point lead on the way to a 121-94 victory.

"It was alarm," center Marreese Speights said of his reaction. "All the guys saw how emotional Steph was. We've never seen that before. It was like, `There's no way we're losing this game. We're going to go out and play the best we can play for him."'

Shaun Livingston already started in Curry's place for Games 2 and 3, and will be called upon again to carry a bigger load until Curry can play again.

"That's where it comes to me being assertive and aggressive, exposing mismatches, making them make adjustments. Then also, too, when I'm able to do that, and score and be aggressive, then it opens the floor up a little bit for our shooters and for other guys," Livingston said. "We're more locked into attention to detail."

That moment seeing Curry go down shook Speights. He had never seen his superstar teammate emotionally break or come close to tears, so Curry's display of dejection immediately after the knee injury Sunday was hard to see.

"It's a feeling that everybody has in their heart, to see how emotional he was," Speights said. "He's a great guy. You never want to see a guy like that go down like that. ... Things happen for a reason. He's going to be all right. We're going to be good, too."

In fact, watching Curry go down fueled his teammates. They weren't going to see him like that and not fight to win it in Curry's honor.

And just as Golden State has shown all season when someone goes down, this group believes in depth as one of its biggest strengths.

"We feel good because we've had this experience before. We've had it during the regular season, we've had it in this series and in the second half of the last game," small forward Harrison Barnes said. "We want to continue to build on that momentum and get off to a good start."
2cb8aa4a-4acf-41a5-b6ec-f3bff2dcb77a  — Tom Thibodeau came to Minnesota for the impressive young core of talent assembled.

He came to the Timberwolves for the shiny new facilities and the chance to take over a team that has been at the bottom of the NBA and bring it back into the playoffs.

And he came to work with a close friend in Scott Layden, forming a partnership with a man he has trusted for nearly two decades after he clashed with Bulls management in a messy exit from the Chicago last spring.

"For me personally, this is about alignment," Thibodeau said on Tuesday in a press conference that introduced him as the new Timberwolves president of basketball operations and coach. "It's not about power. It's not about any of that stuff. I've known Scott a long time. We've shared philosophies with each other about certain things. He was the person that I really wanted. So I'm glad we had the opportunity to get him."

Arena Link: Tom Thibodeau Tom Thibodeau talks with NBA TV's Rick Kamla about joining Minnesota as head coach and president of basketball operations.

Layden comes to Minnesota after four years as an assistant general manager in San Antonio. The two got to know each other when Layden was the GM of the New York Knicks and Thibodeau was an assistant on Jeff Van Gundy's coaching staff back in 1999.

"I was an assistant coach at the time and he talked to me all the time about what do you see, what do you think," Thibodeau said. "Those were important questions to me."

Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor broke the bank to bring these two in to reshape a franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2004. He spent more than $10 million on the pair, with the bulk of the money going to Thibodeau, widely regarded to be the best coach available on the market.

The move to get Layden may turn out to be equally important. The son of a coach, Layden also was an executive in Utah and New York and spent the last four years learning under Popovich and Buford in San Antonio.

"We have this saying where you go in a room, you debate, you disagree, but the most important thing is coming out of the room committed, and we will be committed," Layden said. "I certainly have known Coach a long time. It is about the relationship, it is about doing this together. Coach has the president's title, but I actually think the title of coach is as important if not more important. That is the way I grew up. I am thrilled with this relationship."

Armed with a team that has an impressive array of young players including Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Zach LaVine and Ricky Rubio, Taylor felt the need to act quickly and decisively because he sees this moment as the third time since he bought the team in 1995 to build a championship contender.

"We have an outstanding group of young players," Taylor said. "And this is a unique opportunity for us to go for the championship again. Not for one year. Not for two years. But over many years if we can put this together right."

Wolves Introduce Thibodeau The Minnesota Timberwolves introduce Tom Thibodeau as head coach and president of basketball operations.

Taylor, who has entertained selling a minority share in the team to a group led by Memphis Grizzlies minority owner Steve Kaplan with the plan that Kaplan would one day take over as majority partner, also made it clear that he is in this for the long haul. He gave both Thibodeau and Layden five-year contracts and said he doesn't envision handing over power during the duration of those deals.

"I'm with these guys for the long run," the 75-year-old Taylor said. "This is not going to be a one-year, two-year, three-year, four-year, five-year deal. In my mind, this is going to be longer than that and I'm committed to this team over that period of time."

That kind of stability is what the young Wolves have been searching for after a tumultuous season. Beloved president and coach Flip Saunders died just days before the season started and coach Sam Mitchell and GM Milt Newton basically went through the entire year on a trial basis.

"I love stability, so the ability to know who you're going to have every year, it brings a sense of relief and a comfort," Towns said. "We're just following Glen Taylor's direction and going down the same path."

Returning to the city where he got his NBA start after spending a year away has clearly energized Thibodeau. He spoke fondly of being an assistant under Bill Musselman on the first two Timberwolves teams and said he holds no ill will toward the Bulls organization, particularly GM Gar Forman and VP of Basketball Operations John Paxson.

"I learned a lot from that whole situation," Thibodeau said. "Most of my experience there was very, very positive. When you look back, nothing's going to be perfect. But in the end, when you look at it all, I look back on that experience as very positive for me."

6742563a-1e72-408a-8a5d-fc8b2d46bfdd  — Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert are teaming up to try to bring a Major League Soccer team to downtown Detroit.

MLS says Commissioner Don Garber will be in Detroit on Wednesday for meetings with the potential ownership group, and there's a news conference scheduled for that day. Garber recently said Detroit was a candidate to get a team.

Gores and Gilbert, both of whom graduated Michigan State, said in a joint statement: "Detroit is rising and we know firsthand the power of sports to lift a community and drive a civic renaissance. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing Major League Soccer to Detroit and building an ownership group that represents a cross-section of investors."

On Thursday, Garber called St. Louis and Sacramento, California, front-runners for the next round of expansion, which could occur as soon as 2020.

He said other candidates, in priority order, were Detroit; San Diego; San Antonio and Austin, Texas; and Cincinnati.

"I've always believed a sports franchise is a community asset with the power to unite and inspire people," said Gores, who became owner of the Pistons in 2011. "I'm excited to partner with Dan and help in Detroit's resurgence. Together we have all the tools we need to make a new team successful."

Gilbert, a Detroit native, has invested more than $2.2 billion to purchase and renovate more than 90 commercial properties in the city.

"Soccer is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world with a passionate fan base and global reach," Gilbert said. "Bringing a team downtown will also further energize Detroit's urban core, which is critical to the entire city's overall health and vibrancy."
221f1fdf-720b-4df2-b320-4ec3d44b9117  — Blake Griffin is out for the rest of the playoffs after aggravating his left quadriceps tendon and Chris Paul had right hand surgery Tuesday, leaving the Los Angeles Clippers without their top two players for the remainder of their first-round series against Portland.

The team said Griffin had an MRI that revealed no further structural damage to the quad that sidelined him for 45 games earlier in the season. He's expected to be ready for training camp in September.

Paul had surgery to repair a hand fracture sustained in the third quarter of Monday night's 98-84 loss in Game 4 that allowed Portland to tie the best-of-seven series 2-2.

Griffin averaged 15.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.0 assists, while Paul averaged 23.8 points, 7.3 assists and 4.0 rebounds in the team's first four playoff games.

Game 5 is Wednesday at Staples Center.

"We still have home court. No one has won a road game yet in this series," coach Doc Rivers said. "Now we have to find a way of winning tomorrow and that's as far as we can think right now. My job with the guys is to make sure that they're ready and focused. It's easy when you have the injuries we have to think all kinds of other stuff."

Rivers had not yet decided who will start in place of Griffin and Paul.

"We've had 10 different lineups on the board," he said. "Most likely it will be a pretty big lineup."

The Clippers are 25-21 in regular-season games and 1-1 in the playoffs without Paul, who missed two games against Houston in last year's Western Conference semifinals.

"We have a very competitive basketball team and they have proven that all year," Rivers said. "We have won games before without key guys and we can win games in the future without key guys."

In the final two weeks of the regular season, the Clippers won by two points at Oklahoma City and by three points in overtime at Utah without Griffin and Paul.

Paul controls the Clippers' offense like few others in the NBA. However, they installed a motion offense for when Paul wasn't on the floor this season, freeing up scoring guards Jamal Crawford and Austin Rivers while letting anyone else get the ball moving.

"We were very effective at it," Doc Rivers said. "Thank god we did that because now playing without him we'll be in motion for 48 minutes."
870190f6-e045-434d-933e-07715a560eb9  — Dirk Nowitzki isn't retiring, and the 7-foot German is all but certain that he will spend a 19th season with the Mavericks.

The Dallas star said Tuesday it was "pretty much" crazy talk for coach Rick Carlisle to suggest after a first-round elimination in Oklahoma City that Nowitzki might consider playing elsewhere. He led the Mavericks in scoring again a season after someone else did it for the first time in 15 years.

The Mavericks have not won a playoff series since taking the franchise's first title in 2011. But Nowitzki still believes the team can contend.

Dallas has to decide what a balky right knee means for the future of versatile young forward Chandler Parsons, who wants to return.
4450be51-e8f9-4519-b13a-37ba27dfe438  — The L.A. Clippers announced today the following injury updates:

Forward Blake Griffin will miss the remainder of the 2016 NBA Playoffs after aggravating the injury to his left quad tendon last night in Game 4. Griffin underwent an MRI this morning that revealed no further structural damage, and the five-time NBA All-Star will be ready for the start of 2016-17 training camp.

Griffin originally injured the quad on December 25th in a game against the Lakers and missed 41 games this season due to the injury.

In four playoff games, Griffin averaged 15.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.0 assists. In the regular season he averaged 21.4 points, 8.4 rebounds and 4.9 assists in 35 games (all starts) for the Clippers.

Guard Chris Paul underwent surgery this morning in Los Angeles to repair a right hand fracture suffered in the third quarter of last night's game against Portland. Dr. Steve Shin performed the operation and Paul will be out indefinitely.

In four playoff games, Paul averaged 23.8 points, 7.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals. The All-Star point guard averaged 19.5 points 10.0 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 74 regular season games (all starts) for the Clippers.
155f2dda-5200-4485-a050-35c616e23683  — Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld announced today that Scott Brooks has been hired as the team's new head coach. Brooks will become the 24th head coach in franchise history. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released.

"I am beyond thrilled to return to coaching with a team that is filled with such potential and to be able to join an organization that is committed to helping us reach our goals," said Brooks. "I'm very grateful to Ted Leonsis and Ernie Grunfeld for this opportunity and I can promise the great fans of Washington that we will work extremely hard both on and off the court to represent them in a manner fitting the most powerful city in the world."

Brooks joins the Wizards after serving as the Oklahoma City Thunder's head coach for seven seasons (2008-09 through 2014-15). With Brooks at the helm, the Thunder amassed a 338-207 (.620) record, tallied four 50-plus win seasons (including 60 wins in 2012-13), made three appearances in the Western Conference Finals (2011, 2012, 2014), and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals.

"Scott's approach to the game, track record for player development and ability to communicate with his players made him the clear-cut choice to guide our team as we continue to rise as contenders in the Eastern Conference," said Monumental Sports & Entertainment Founder and Wizards Majority Owner Ted Leonsis. "His accomplishments as a coach are matched only by his sterling reputation around the league and we're confident that our fans and players alike will embrace and support him as he leads the way."

Brooks was named the 2009-10 NBA Coach of the Year after guiding OKC to a 50-32 record in his first full season as head coach and leading the team to a 27-win improvement (tied for the eighth-largest in NBA history). He also was twice named as head coach for the Western Conference All-Star Team (2012 and 2014). Brooks was originally promoted to head coach of the Thunder on April 15, 2009, after being named interim head coach on Nov. 22, 2008.

"Scott was our top candidate and we moved quickly on an agreement to make him our head coach," said Grunfeld. "His presence, the core players we have returning and our cap flexibility this summer have us all looking forward to the possibilities of what our team can accomplish."

Before joining the Thunder (then Seattle Supersonics) organization as an assistant prior to the 2007-08 season, Brooks spent the 2006-07 season working as an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings. His NBA coaching career began with the Denver Nuggets, where he served as an assistant coach from 2003-06. Brooks helped lead the Nuggets to the playoffs in each of his three seasons on the bench, with the team compiling a 136-110 (.560) regular season record. In 2000, Brooks was a player/assistant coach with the Los Angeles Stars of the ABA. The following season, he served as the head coach of the Southern California Surf of the ABA, guiding the club to a 23-14 record.

A native of Lathrop, Calif., Brooks played 10 seasons in the NBA, appearing in 680 regular season games with Philadelphia, Minnesota, Houston, Dallas, New York and Cleveland. He won an NBA championship in 1994 as a member of the Houston Rockets. The 5-11 guard retired with career averages of 4.9 points and 2.4 assists.
cf4be8dd-899c-4a93-bdec-c20cd284b091  — Game 4 of the Warriors-Rockets series drew the largest television audience for the first round of the NBA playoffs in 14 years.

With MVP Stephen Curry returning from an ankle injury then spraining his knee late in the first half, Golden State's 121-94 victory Sunday averaged more than 7.2 million viewers on ABC.

ESPN said Tuesday that's the most since a Trail Blazers-Lakers game in 2002.
bd0e84a2-0af7-4916-87ef-a9df98a19d3c  — The Golden State Warriors' Steve Kerr, whose team won an NBA-record 73 games, is the recipient of the Red Auerbach Trophy as the 2015-16 NBA Coach of the Year, the NBA announced today. He becomes the Warriors' first winner since Don Nelson in the 1991-92 season.

Kerr, in his second season as Golden State head coach, received 64 first-place votes and 381 total points from a panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. The Portland Trail Blazers' Terry Stotts, who guided his team to the playoffs with four new starters, finished second with 37 first-place votes and 335 total points. Three-time winner Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs was third with 10 first-place votes and 166 total points. Coaches were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote.

Under Kerr and assistant coach Luke Walton, who served as interim head coach until Kerr returned from back-surgery complications in January, the Warriors (73-9) posted the best regular-season record in league history, eclipsing the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72-10). The defending NBA champions opened the season 24-0, the best start in league history, which pushed their overall regular-season winning streak to 28 games, the second longest of all time.

The Warriors set NBA records for single-season road victories (34) and consecutive home regular-season wins (54, including 18 victories to finish last season), and went 39-2 at Oracle Arena for the second season in a row. Golden State also became the first team to go through a season without losing two games in a row or losing to the same team twice.

The Warriors excelled at both ends of the court. They established an NBA record with 1,077 three-pointers, part of a high-powered offense that posted the league's highest scoring average (114.9 ppg) since the 1991-92 season and led the NBA in offensive rating (112.5 points per 100 possessions), field goal percentage (48.7), three-point field goal percentage (41.6, second highest in NBA history) and assists (28.9 apg). On defense, the Warriors tied for fourth in defensive rating, allowing 100.9 points per 100 possessions.

The Coach of the Year Award is named after legendary coach and Hall of Famer Red Auerbach, who guided the Celtics to nine NBA championships. In 1996, Auerbach was honored as one of the Top 10 Coaches in NBA History as the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary.

6a9f68b1-7ed2-4d68-89a4-03ddb7714de0  — Chris Paul broke a bone in his right hand midway through the third quarter and left the Clippers' Game 4 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.

It was not clear exactly how the nine-time All-Star was injured, but it appeared he may have bent his wrist awkwardly when defending Portland's Gerald Henderson on a layup.

"He'll get evaluated, but it obviously doesn't look very good," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said after the Blazers' 98-84 victory evened the series at two games piece.

The Clippers were also hurt late in the game when Blake Griffin appeared to aggravate the left quad injury that he struggled with this season.

Paul retreated to the bench and was attended to by team trainers before leaving for the locker room. He angrily kicked at a seat cushion on the court as he left. The Clippers later reported Paul fractured the third metacarpal in his right hand.

He'll get evaluated, but it obviously doesn't look very good. – Doc Rivers, on Chris Paul's injury

Following the game, Paul left the Moda Center without speaking with reporters.

"He was clearly disappointed, upset, but there's nothing you can do," Griffin said about his teammate. "You try to tell a guy, like, 'It's OK. We got you and it's going to be OK.' He's a competitor and he wants to play so it's tough. It's not easy dealing with injuries this time of year."

Paul was leading the Clippers with 16 points when he left the game. He averaged 26.3 points and 8.3 assists through the first three games of the series, after averaging 19.5 points and 10 assists in the regular season.

Griffin looked dejected when he went to the bench with a little more than 5 minutes left in the game. Afterward, he said he believes he tweaked his quad when he planted off his left going up against Mason Plumlee in the third quarter.

He's the heart and soul. The head of the snake. He's the guy that gets them going and can single-handedly change the game. – Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum, on Chris Paul

Rivers said: "It doesn't look great for him, either."

The coach gave Griffin a "50-50" chance of playing in Game 5 on Wednesday night in Los Angeles.

"Hopefully in the next 24-48 hours you turn a corner and feel better, so I'm not really concentrating on how it felt tonight, that's kind of expected after you tweak something," Griffin said.

While celebrating their win, the Blazers were also mindful of the hit that the Clippers had taken.

"Obviously losing a guy like CP3 hurts a lot," CJ McCollum said. "He's the heart and soul. The head of the snake. He's the guy that gets them going and can single-handedly change the game."

Rivers was trying not to dwell on the Clippers' plight.

"We're going home. All they've done is win two games at home just like we won two games at home," the coach said. "We've been in adverse situations all year, but our guys have come through and I expect us to do that at our place."
5f660bb2-8ba9-4591-a48d-b7804990b6c3  — The NBA says Reggie Jackson was not fouled on the final play of Detroit's loss to Cleveland, when the point guard complained after the game that referees should be penalized for mistakes.

Jackson rushed up the floor and missed a jumper under heavy pressure from Kyrie Irving as the Cavaliers finished off a 100-98 victory Sunday that gave them a four-game sweep.

Jackson called for "fines, suspensions, being fired" for referees, adding: "Make bad plays or questionable, you're not really being productive to the sport. Things should have consequences, just like the players."

But the NBA ruled Monday in its report about the last 2 minutes of the game that Irving maintained legal guarding position and made no contact with Jackson as he initially reached in for the steal, and that Jackson initiated the contact on the shot attempt by jumping sideways.
47a3de45-e5d5-4485-80e2-cfc55029af79  — Toronto's Dwane Casey has won the Rudy Tomjanovich Award, given by the Professional Basketball Writers Association to an NBA coach who combines cooperation with the media and fans with excellence on the court.

Casey beat out Charlotte's Steve Clifford, the Clippers' Doc Rivers, Boston's Brad Stevens and Detroit's Stan Van Gundy in voting Monday.

Casey led Toronto to a franchise-best 56-26 record and the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. He will be presented the trophy Tuesday before the Raptors host Indiana, with their series tied 2-2.

The award is named for former NBA coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who led the Rockets to consecutive titles in 1994 and 1995. Golden State's Steve Kerr won last year.
2a13b7c7-e3d7-467d-ae15-a6d9d90427c9  — Los Angeles Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak doesn't think his search for a new coach will take a long time.

Kupchak told the team's official television network Monday that he has a large list of candidates to be the Lakers' fourth full-time coach since 2011, but expects to narrow the field quickly.

"I think it's unlikely there will be anything done in the next week or two," Kupchak said on Time Warner Cable SportsNet. "But certainly I don't anticipate this dragging into the summer. We'd like to get it done. We're looking to have a big offseason. It would be nice to have our staff in place during the draft, and certainly when July 1 rolls around."

A quick coaching search hasn't always been a priority in Los Angeles during owner Jim Buss' tenure atop the basketball operations department. The Lakers' last search lasted nearly three months - or 89 days, to be precise - between Mike D'Antoni's resignation and Byron Scott's hiring in the summer of 2014, well after the draft and free agent signing period.

The Lakers fired Scott on Sunday night after the two worst seasons in the 16-time NBA champion franchise's history. Los Angeles went 38-126 under Scott, including 17-65 in Kobe Bryant's farewell year.

Kupchak said the Lakers dropped Scott due to "a bunch of things. ... If you're going to make a change, make the change now."

He also said the Lakers' miserable record - second-worst in the NBA - wasn't "the primary factor."

The Lakers waited 11 days after their season finale to fire Scott, which meant they missed out on the chance to interview Tom Thibodeau or Scott Brooks, two respected veteran coaches who signed with other teams. Thibodeau would have been highly unlikely to get the same control of basketball operations in Los Angeles that he got in Minnesota.

Kupchak didn't name any candidates for the job, but he is quite familiar with Golden State assistant coach Luke Walton, already a popular candidate among Lakers fans. Walton was a Lakers forward for nine seasons before becoming an assistant in their organization and briefly a broadcaster on their network.

"There are a lot of different arenas that we can look to to find a coach," Kupchak said. "That opens up, clearly, assistants, existing head coaches, and we've got a list. We're trying to narrow the list down. We'll contact some people, and hopefully we'll have some phone conversations, maybe some in-person interviews, and go from there. I don't think it's going to drag out, but you don't know."

The Lakers are in the NBA draft lottery on May 17, and they will keep their first-round pick if it lands in the top three. If not, it goes to Philadelphia under the terms of the long-ago trade for Steve Nash.

Kupchak hopes to land another franchise cornerstone with a high draft pick, but the Lakers' long-standing, win-now mindset during Bryant's career has left an enormous rebuilding project for the new coach.

"We have to rely on the lottery and the luck of the gods to give us a pick this year in the top three," Kupchak said. "We do know we have the second pick in the second round, which will be a good draft pick. And if we don't get this year's (first-round) pick, we'll get next year's pick."
5aac2d00-317d-4ddb-9d28-af47886d192d  — The Cavaliers don't know who they'll play next in the NBA playoffs, but they know when they'll play.

After sweeping eighth-seeded Detroit in the first round, Cleveland has a full week to rest up before its next game. The NBA announced on Monday that the Cavs will host Game 1 against either Boston or Atlanta on May 2. The series between the Celtics and Hawks is tied at two games apiece. Game 5 is Tuesday night in Atlanta.

The Cavs completed their four-game sweep of the Pistons on Sunday night with a 100-98 win.

Kyrie Irving, who broke his kneecap in the NBA Finals last year against Golden State and missed the first two months of this season following surgery, scored 31 points in Game 4. He averaged 27.5 points and shot 47 percent on 3-pointers in the opening-round series.
5e14febb-a051-4f61-a978-4bb16d246834  — Dallas faces elimination without two of its interior threats.

Center Salah Mejri and forward David Lee missed Monday's playoff game against the Oklahoma City Thunder with injuries. Dallas trails the series 3-1.

Mejri initially strained his right hip in the fourth quarter of Saturday's game. The 7-foot-2 rookie center from Tunisia started the playoff opener against the Thunder, then came off the bench the next three games.

Lee sat out with a right plantar fascia injury. He missed the first two games of the series, then played a reserve role in Games 3 and 4, scoring six points in both games.

The Mavericks already were without guard Deron Williams, who has a left abdominal strain/sports hernia. Coach Rick Carlisle has said he doesn't expect Williams to return this season.
627c1bb2-dc89-48ed-866e-0ced69d4b588  — Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside will start Game 4 against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night despite missing the last two practices with a bruised right thigh.

Whiteside's status had been listed as a game-time decision.

Says Miami coach Erick Spoelstra, "Hopefully the adrenaline will kick in and he'll get through it."

Whiteside got hit in the thigh on a pick and roll in the fourth quarter of Saturday night's game.

Charlotte small forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Game 4 with a strained foot. Batum also missed Game 3, which the Hornets won 96-80 at home. Frank Kaminsky will start in his place.

Coach Steve Clifford is unsure if Batum will be ready for Game 5 in Miami on Wednesday night, saying the ankle is "very weak."

Miami leads the series 2-1.
91686b42-5ec2-4f9b-a4cf-917e2c20d549  — Indiana Pacers starting center Ian Mahinmi was limited to non-contact drills at practice Monday because of a lingering lower back injury.

Mahinmi has been listed as questionable for most of the playoff series against Toronto but has started all four games, with the series tied 2-2. On Saturday, Mahinmi scored a career-high 20 points and had 10 rebounds and five assists, which were both playoff career highs.

After practice, Mahinmi told reporters that he was feeling better and has been getting treatment on the back since the end of Game 4. Mahinmi also said he is getting accustomed to playing with the injury.

Game 5 is Tuesday night.
0bfec55c-a4fc-4800-8bb0-17bd4f5ab3af  — Charlotte Hornets forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Game 4 against Miami, while Heat center Hassan White's status will be a game-time decision in their first round series Monday night.

Miami leads the series 2-1.

Hornets coach Steve Clifford said Monday Batum was unable to participate in shootaround and will miss his second straight game with a strained foot. The Hornets beat the Heat 96-80 in Game 3 despite Batum's absence.

Whiteside got hit in the thigh on a pick and roll in the fourth quarter of Saturday night's game and hasn't practiced since.

Whiteside said he will see how the thigh feels before the game prior to making a decision on whether or not to play.
9dd139fd-885e-4377-925e-ad16f9c50351  — Byron Scott will not return to coach the Los Angeles Lakers, the team announced Sunday night.

Scott coached the Lakers for the two worst seasons in the 16-time NBA champion franchise's history, going 38-126.

The Lakers are making a clean break from the Kobe Bryant era by firing the coach who shepherded the superstar guard's farewell season, but couldn't coax many wins out of an otherwise dismal roster. Los Angeles finished with the NBA's second-worst record this season at 17-65, losing four more games than in its previous franchise-worst season in 2014-15.

Scott received praise from general manager Mitch Kupchak last week for his handling of the final months for Bryant, who was Scott's teammate during his rookie season with the Lakers 20 years ago. Bryant scored 60 points in his final game April 13, a win over Utah.

But the Lakers struggled to play competent defense or to put together coherent game plans over the past two seasons with a roster of youngsters and unimpressive veterans.

Scott also didn't seem to connect with the Lakers' young players. His old-school mentality generated little positive effect in Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson or D'Angelo Russell, the second overall pick whose playing time was curiously limited by Scott early in the season.

Although the Lakers acknowledged that Bryant's seasonlong showcase took precedence over winning this season, Kupchak and owner Jim Buss still apparently expected more than Scott provided.

Scott had two seasons with team options left on his contract.

The Lakers are now looking for their fifth head coach since Phil Jackson left in 2011. Mike Brown and Mike D'Antoni were fired before Scott, with interim coach Bernie Bickerstaff also getting a short run.

Scott is a veteran head coach with previous tenures at New Jersey, New Orleans and Cleveland. He led the Nets to two NBA Finals in his first head job, and he won the NBA's Coach of the Year award with the Hornets in 2008.

Yahoo Sports first reported Scott's firing.

The Lakers waited to fire Scott while two top candidates for head coaching positions took other jobs. Tom Thibodeau landed in Minnesota, and Scott Brooks was hired by Washington.

Lakers fans have been intrigued for months by the prospect of hiring Luke Walton, the championship-winning Lakers forward who is an assistant coach on Steve Kerr's staff at Golden State. The 36-year-old Walton, who played nine seasons in Los Angeles, coached Golden State to a 39-4 start to the season while Kerr was sidelined by a back injury.

The Lakers' new coach will inherit a young, patchwork roster with a core of intriguing talent. Russell, Randle and Clarkson are all solid players, and the Lakers will keep their high draft pick if they finish in the top three of the NBA draft lottery next month.

The Lakers also will have more than $40 million in salary cap room to offer free agents, and Scott's absence could help there as well.

The once-glamorous franchise has been incredibly unsuccessful in attracting or keeping marquee free agents over the past four seasons, even losing Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol to other teams for relatively modest contracts. But the departures of Bryant and Scott with the installation of a credible head coach could prove more enticing to stars interested in the added benefits of playing in the Hollywood spotlight.
68979847-443b-4338-952a-832860ca5e66  — The Los Angeles Lakers have decided not to pick up the option for the 2016-17 season on the contract for Head Coach Byron Scott, it was announced Sunday night.

"We would like to thank Byron for his hard work, dedication and loyalty over the last two years, but have decided it is in the best interest of the organization to make a change at this time," said General Manager Mitch Kupchak.

The search for a new head coach will begin immediately.
0733816a-8336-4cac-9c9f-732647f47e4b  — The camera captured Stephen Curry on the bench midway through the second quarter. The image flashed on the video board high above the court, the crowd cheering even a sighting of Curry in street clothes. He looked up to see what the commotion was about and responded with a quick salute, index finger glancing eyebrow.

Curry, in attendance and still very connected. Check.

Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was about reminders. The MVP was close by, in spirit and actual proximity, the Rockets would be no threat to anyone this season until the miserable very end, and the Warriors were surrounded in positives even as they played for the first time since Curry suffered a sprained knee ligament that's scheduled to keep him out at least two weeks.

The upbeat mood returned in the form of a 114-81 Golden State victory and a 4-1 series win with all of 38 minutes of contribution from Curry over two games between an ankle injury and the knee injury that became an urgent concern to the hopes of repeating as champions. There isn't even a way to devalue the accomplishment based on the opponent, not when the Warriors did exactly what they were supposed to do with an average margin of victory of 23.8 points in the 1-8 matchup. They were in control the entire way at home except for a brief scare in the second half of Game 2. It was not expected to be close, and it wasn't.

Order has so been restored that the Warriors are surrounded by new reasons to be encouraged, beyond the old ones (73 wins in the regular season, great offense, very good defense, the experience of the title run a year ago, etc.). That's how fast their world has tilted back.

Sunday -- Curry suffers the knee injury late in the first half of Game 4 on Sunday in Houston and does not return. It is the second time in the series, following the ankle injury in the opener, that he does no make it through a game, in addition to entirely missing two other contests.

We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster. – Shaun Livingston on Stephen Curry

Monday -- Concerns are confirmed. An examination shows Curry has sprained the medial collateral ligament in the right knee, a big enough setback that the Warriors say he won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks. It's partly semantics -- Curry will be in constant contact with the Golden State medical staff, just not scheduled for an official update for two weeks -- but also underlining that he is not expected to miss a couple games. The absence could also drag past the original estimate.

Wednesday -- Klay Thompson makes seven of 11 3-pointers and scores 27 points in 29 minutes, Shaun Livingston has 16 points on seven-for-eight shooting as Curry's replacement at point guard, the Warriors commit only 10 turnovers and recalibrate the mood.

"It's good news for us, but more importantly it's moving forward," Livingston said. "We don't know how long he's going to be out. Obviously we're going to miss him, but at the same time there is a lot of basketball to play, and for the next series it's a good momentum booster."

And about those Western Conference semifinals: It will start here Sunday at the earliest, if the Portland Trail Blazers finish tipping over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, and Tuesday at Oracle if Los Angeles and Portland have a Game 7 on Sunday. The clock will be running on Curry's recovery timeline while potentially knocking off another five days, Thursday through Monday, without missing a game. The schedule once the Western Conference semifinals do start could provide another assist, depending on the spacing between contests to accommodate TV and arena availability in the cities.

The world around the Warriors has also changed dramatically (and for the better) in recent days. The Clippers had a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, after all, and even after losing Game 3 had reason to feel good with Chris Paul at starring and Blake Griffin showing signs of regaining his rhythm after missing 47 games since Christmas (hand, leg injuries and team-mandated suspension). The Clippers at full strength -- with the Warriors down their best player for at least a few games, giving Paul a big edge at point guard -- could have been interesting if the teams met in the semis.

It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it. You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. – Draymond Green on winning without Stephen Curry

Then that notion went into a blender. Griffin aggravated his leg injury and was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs, Paul fractured his right hand and was declared out for at least four weeks and the Clippers went from up 2-0 to down 3-2 after losing Wednesday at Staples Center.

For a team supposedly in a difficult spot with the loss of Curry, a lot of things have started to break right for Golden State.

"It definitely gives you more confidence, for sure because you know you can do it," forward Draymond Green said. "You know the blueprint to doing it. So we know what we have to do when he's not out there. Hopefully when he comes back we can continue to do that. But while he's out, we got the blueprint on what it takes to win when he's not out there, and we need to continue to follow that.

"It definitely helps the confidence a bit, and this win tonight, everybody chipped in. It wasn't one or two guys. Obviously Klay heated up. Shaun had a good game. I was able to play well, [Andrew] Bogut played well, Ian [Clark] played well, Brandon Rush played well, Harrison [Barnes] chipped in.

"Everybody who came in, Anderson Varejao, who hasn't played the entire series, came in the game with big minutes. That's a true professional. The gratifying thing about this win is everybody chipped in, and that's what it's got to be about when Steph's not out there."

The Warriors were so impressive in clinching 11 months to the day they beat the Rockets to win the Western Conference title and advance to The Finals for the first time in 40 years that Houston interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Golden State minus Curry is still one of the top two teams in the league. Speaking of noteworthy updates.

"I have no idea where we line up with the rest of the league without Steph," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "It's not my job to do that. That's [the media's] job. But we do feel confident that we can win games without him, but we don't really want to have to. So hopefully Steph will be back soon. In the meantime, we'll have to continue to hold down the fort."
