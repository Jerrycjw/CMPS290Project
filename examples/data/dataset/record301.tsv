The Golden State Warriors' record-setting 73rd win generated a record local television rating as well.

CSN Bay Area said Wednesday's game between Golden State and Memphis got a 23.2 rating for the highest mark on record for an NBA game on a regional sports network. That means 23.2 percent of homes with televisions in the metropolitan area were tuned in.

The highest rating the Bulls got on SportsChannel Chicago when they set the previous wins mark in 1995-96 was 22.9 for their record-setting 70th victory.

The Grizzlies-Warriors matchup was shown outside of the Bay Area on ESPN, where it averaged more than 3.6 million viewers for the most-watched regular-season NBA game on the network in more than two years.

At the same time, Kobe Bryant's final career game averaged almost 3.5 million viewers on ESPN2, the largest audience ever for a regular-season NBA game on that channel. In the final minutes, after 1 a.m. on the East Coast, nearly 5.4 million people were watching.
