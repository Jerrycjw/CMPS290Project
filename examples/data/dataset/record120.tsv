Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes has been suspended one game without pay for attempting to enter the Milwaukee Bucks' locker room and verbally challenging Milwaukee forward John Henson following both players' ejections on Thursday, March 17, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

In addition, Milwaukee guard Greivis Vasquez has been fined $15,000 for following Henson to the locker room, while Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and center Greg Monroe have each been fined $10,000 for their roles in the incident.

The incident began when Henson blocked Barnes' shot with 5.5 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of the Bucks' 96-86 win over the Grizzlies at BMO Harris Bradley Center. Following the play, Henson taunted Barnes and was subsequently assessed two technical fouls and ejected. Barnes was then charged with a technical foul and ejected for continuing use of obscenities.

Barnes will serve his suspension tonight when Memphis hosts the Los Angeles Clippers at FedExForum.
