New Orleans guard Eric Gordon again broke his right ring finger during Saturday night's game against the Utah Jazz, a 106-94 loss.

Gordon left the game in the first half after a collision with Jazz center Rudy Gobert. He headed toward the locker room and did not return with the team when the second half began. The Pelicans announced his latest diagnosis during the third quarter.

"He worked so hard to get back and I really thought he was playing good basketball," Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said after the game of Gordon, who had averaged nearly 23 points in his first three games back from the initial injury. "So for that to happen to him again ... that's really unfortunate."

Gordon missed 16 games with a fractured right ring finger before returning Feb. 27. He provided an instant scoring boost, averaging nearly 23 points during his first three games back in the lineup. He has averaged about 15.4 points this season.
