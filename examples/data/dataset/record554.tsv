â€” Australia will host a Basketball without Borders camp for the first time next month.

The NBA and FIBA will bring a camp to Dandenong Basketball Stadium in Melbourne from June 23-26, the NBA announced Monday.

The camp will bring together the top male players born in 1999 from the Asia-Pacific region to learn from NBA and FIBA players and coaches, and to compete against top young players from the region. The roster of players and coaches will be announced later.

The Basketball without Borders camps began in 2001 and have reached more than 2,500 participants from 130 countries and territories, with 37 campers drafted into the NBA.
