After mid-February's trade deadline. let's see how six players dealt two weeks ago are performing on their new teams:

Tobias Harris, Pistons

Harris has arguably been the most productive player of any dealt two weeks ago. In seven games for Detroit, Harris is averaging 16.9 points on 50.0 percent shooting, 1.4 3-pointers, 5.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 32.7 minutes. The Pistons are 4-1 since inserting Harris into the starting lineup, with their first loss coming in San Antonio on Wednesday. Coach Stan Van Gundy already "feels comfortable when [Harris] has the ball", and one would assume that confidence will continue to grow over the final six weeks of the regular season. Harris looks to be a great fit in Detroit and his fantasy owners should be pleased with his increased production.

Brandon Jennings & Ersan Ilyasova, Magic

The other end of the Harris-to-Detroit trade saw Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova shipped to Orlando. Ilyasova has been more efficient in Orlando, but has received almost 10 less minutes per game over his first eight games with the Magic. Jennings has also seen less action than many expected with averages of 7.9 points on 36.2 percent shooting, 1.4 3-pointers, 3.6 assists and 1.8 rebounds in 17.4 minutes. Both players are notorious for their hot streaks, so keep an eye on their production and don't be afraid to pick them up if it seems they're starting to find a groove. Coach Scott Skiles could decide to rely on these veterans more as the Magic continue to chase the playoffs. But at the moment, neither are worth rostering in standard leagues.

Markieff Morris, Wizards

The talented-yet-complicated forward received his wish two weeks ago when Phoenix sent him to Washington. Unfortunately for Morris and the Wizards, the transaction hasn't reaped many benefits yet. In eight games with Washington, Morris is averaging 8.0 points on 36.5 percent from the field, 7.1 percent (!) from 3-point, 5.9 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 0.8 blocks in 24.1 minutes. His minutes have increased to 30.7 over the last two games after entering the starting lineup. But his field goal percentage still makes him an unsavory addition. If he can bring that category up on a consistent basis, he's very much worth consideration for his unique combination of points, rebounds, steals and blocks.

Jeff Green, Clippers

Doc Rivers and the Clippers snagged Green from the Grizzlies two weeks ago with the hope he could solidify their stable of bench bigs. The returns have been mixed so far. In six games with Los Angeles, Green is averaging 9.7 points on 41.1 percent shooting, 1.2 3-pointers, 4.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 24.7 minutes. This stretch includes a 22-point outing against the Kings with four 3-pointers and five rebounds. It seems Green's role will be similar to what it was in Memphis, where he could score 20-plus points on any given night but didn't provide consistent enough statistics to be worthy of a roster spot in standard leagues. Green should be a good plug-and-play option for the remainder of the regular season if you need points, 3-pointers or rebounds. Just don't plan to keep him on your roster for more than a couple games at a time.

Lance Stephenson, Grizzlies

The player who the Clippers used to acquire Green has been solid with the Grizzlies over his first six games with averages of 11.8 points on 51.8 percent shooting, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 22.5 minutes. These minutes are solid for Stephenson, but his game doesn't translate well to the fantasy world as he doesn't hit 3-pointers or accumulate many defensive stats. There isn't much reason for Stephenson to be on your fantasy roster unless he's a weekend pickup to chase points and rebounds.

Stat Line of the Week

Nightly Notable: Stephen Curry Steph Curry torched the opposition for 46 points, including 12 3-pointers to lead the Warriors over the Thunder in overtime.

February 27 vs. Oklahoma City -- 46 points (14-24 FG, 12-16 3P, 6-8 FT), six assists, three rebounds, two steals, three turnovers in 38 minutes

Weekend Pickups

Bobby Portis, Bulls (26 percent owned)

The Bulls rookie continues to receive solid minutes with Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson out of the lineup for Chicago. Over his last three games, Portis is averaging 10.0 points on 45.2 percent shooting, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 27.0 minutes. He's worth a look this weekend if you need rebounds with a dash of everything else. The Bulls matchup with the Rockets on Saturday.

D.J. Augustin, Nuggets (10 percent owned)

The newest Nugget has been up-and-down over his first seven games in Denver with averages of 13.0 points on 48.3 percent shooting, 1.9 3-pointers, 3.7 assists and 1.6 rebounds in 23.2 minutes. He scored a season-high 26 points on Wednesday against the Lakers with three 3-pointers and five assists in 23 minutes. He's worth a look this weekend if you need points, 3-pointers and assists. The Nuggets matchup with the Nets on Friday and the Mavericks on Sunday.

Mario Hezonja, Magic (6 percent owned)

The Magic rookie dominated for a career-high 21 points in 37 minutes on Tuesday as he fills in for Evan Fournier (wrist) in Orlando's starting lineup. Magic coach Scott Skiles is notoriously sporadic with his playing time, so Hezonja could drop back down to his normal playing time any game. But if Fournier is out of the lineup again this weekend (he's questionable) then Hezonja is worth a look for points, 3-pointers and rebounds. The Magic host the Suns on Friday.
