â€” The NBA says next month's draft will return to Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the fourth straight year.

The draft will be held June 23 at the home of the Nets, who don't have a first-round pick. They previously traded it to the Boston Celtics, who have the No. 3 selection.

The Philadelphia 76ers won the draft lottery Tuesday and have the No. 1 selection, followed by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Tickets will be available beginning Monday at www.nbatickets.com
