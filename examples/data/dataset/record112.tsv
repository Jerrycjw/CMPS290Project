Anthony Davis' season is over. Alvin Gentry told reporters during his pregame media session Sunday that New Orleans has decided to shut down the three-time All-Star for the remaining 14 games of 2015-16, a decision that factors in the 23-year-old's left knee and shoulder injuries.

"We're going to shut him down. He's done for the year," Gentry said. "It's unfortunate, but he's got an issue with his shoulder that he's played with the whole season. It's amazing when people talk about him being soft or whatever; they don't understand that he's played through a situation with his shoulder the entire season."
