â€” Despite getting more attention from Canadian TV viewers, the Toronto Raptors are still struggling to compete with hockey and baseball.

Canadian sports network Sportsnet says the Raptors' first-round Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers had average audience of 1.53 million viewers Sunday night, making it the most-watched Raptors game ever in Canada.

Still, the NBA team was outdrawn by Saturday's NHL draft lottery, which pulled in an average of 1.57 million viewers.

Meanwhile, the network says the second round of the NHL playoff series between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals is averaging 1.5 million viewers, while a regular-season baseball game between the Toronto Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday attracted an average of 1.1 million viewers.

Toronto hosts Miami on Tuesday night in the opening game of its second-round series. The series is Toronto's first appearance in the second round of the NBA playoffs since 2001.

The Raptors are also benefiting from not having to share TV time with a Canadian NHL team this postseason. Last year's first-round series between the Montreal Canadiens and Ottawa Senators averaged 3.2 million viewers per game on CBC, according to Sportsnet.
