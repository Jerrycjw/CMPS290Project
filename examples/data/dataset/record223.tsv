The Pelicans say guard Jrue Holiday and forward Alonzo Gee will miss the rest of this season because of injuries, joining a slew of sidelined New Orleans teammates.

Both Holiday and Gee were injured in Monday night's victory over the New York Knicks.

The Pelicans, who issued medical updates Tuesday, say Holiday's orbital eyewall was fractured when he was hit by an apparently inadvertent elbow from Kristaps Porzingis. The club says Gee ruptured a muscle in his right thigh.

Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, and guards Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon and Bryce Dejean-Jones, already had been shut down for the season.

Meanwhile, the Pelicans say forward Ryan Anderson has been diagnosed with a sports hernia and is seeking a second opinion, and that Norris Cole remains day-to-day with back soreness.
