Memphis coach Dave Joerger said Friday that Grizzlies rookie forward Jarell Martin will be out "quite a while" with an injured left foot that has him officially out of Game 3 of their Western Conference playoff series with the San Antonio Spurs.

Joerger said before the game that Martin is devastated by this latest injury.

"My heart breaks for him," Joerger said. "He's going to be out for quite a while it sounds like. It's a tough deal, you know. He's one of the kindest, most soft-spoken, quietest, nice guys we have on the team."

The 6-foot-10 Martin was Memphis' first-round draft pick last June with the 25th pick overall. He didn't make his NBA debut until Dec. 18 after needing offseason surgery on his left foot. He played in 27 games and averaged 5.7 points and 3.2 rebounds as a rookie.

He scored five points in Game 1 and four in Game 2. San Antonio leads the best-of-seven series 2-0.

Martin joins a lengthy list of injured Grizzlies. Memphis also is missing Mike Conley (left Achilles tendinitis), Marc Gasol (right foot fracture), Jordan Adams (right knee surgery) and Brandan Wright (right medial collateral ligament sprain).

The Grizzlies also listed forward JaMychal Green as probable despite dealing with flu-like symptoms.
