Golden State coach Steve Kerr says he is holding Australian center Andrew Bogut out of the game with Memphis on Saturday for some rest before playing at San Antonio on Sunday as the Warriors chase the NBA single-season wins record.

Kerr said after the shootaround he just didn't want Bogut to play both games with everyone else available. Bogut has started 64 of 68 games this season, averaging 20.7 minutes.

The coach says any player who is banged up should tell him, and Kerr also wants to limit minutes played against Memphis.

Kerr says the Warriors will try to win the game but not at the expense of wearing people out.

The Warriors (70-9) have three games left to pass the 72-10 record of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls.
