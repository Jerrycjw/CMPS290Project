The Sacramento Kings have suspended center DeMarcus Cousins for one game for "conduct detrimental to the team."

Vlade Divac, the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager, announced the disciplinary action Thursday. The Kings said Cousins would sit out Friday's home game against the Orlando Magic.

While the Kings offered no other details about Cousins' conduct, video from Sacramento's 120-111 home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday showed Cousins sitting on the bench and in the huddle yelling and heatedly gesturing with his arm at coach George Karl, who was only a couple of feet away.

Divac was seen speaking after the game outside the locker room with Cousins, who scored 29 points and 11 rebounds in the loss. Cousins and Karl have been at odds previously.
