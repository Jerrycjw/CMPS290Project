A person with knowledge of the deal says the Minnesota Timberwolves are planning to call up forward Greg Smith from the D-League for a 10-day contract.

The person tells The Associated Press that Smith was informed on Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been officially announced.

With Kevin Garnett, Nikola Pekovic and Nemanja Bjelica all out with injuries, the Timberwolves are in need of some depth in the front court. Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng are playing heavy minutes, and the Wolves want to reduce the load on their promising young big men.

The 6-foot-10 Smith played parts of three seasons with the Houston Rockets and played 42 games for the Dallas Mavericks last year. He has averaged 12.4 points in 16 games for the Raptors this season.
