Golden State forward Andre Iguodala will miss at least two weeks due to a sprained left ankle.

Iguodala got hurt in the second half of the league-leading Warriors' 128-112 win against Portland on Friday. He will be re-evaluated in two weeks.

"It's a big deal. It's a really big deal," Kerr said before Saturday's game against Phoenix. "Andre's so important to everything we do. Not only just in terms of schematically, but just emotionally."

The 32-year-old Iguodala was the NBA Finals MVP last year when the Warriors won the title for the first time since 1975. The reserve is averaging 7.3 points and 4.1 rebounds in 60 games this season.

Kerr said he expects reserve forward Brandon Rush will see an increase in minutes. Point guard Ian Clark also could get more time on the court.

"We've got a lot of guys who are really smart players, who understand the game, who know the ebbs and flows, when to calm things down," Kerr said. "We have to get the right combinations out there. But nobody's going to replace Andre. He's the Finals MVP, one of the smartest guys I've ever been around."
