Detroit Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson is missing a matchup with the Miami Heat because of an abdominal strain.

Miami reserve forward Justise Winslow also sat out of the possibly pivotal game Tuesday night with a sprained left ankle.

Both playoff-bound teams were trying to improve their playoff positioning.

Jackson's absence appeared to come as a surprise after he took part in warmups more about an hour before the game. Steve Blake started in Jackson's place, but the Pistons didn't expect him to really replace a player who averages a team-high 18.8 points a game.

Winslow left Miami's game on Sunday night against Orlando with a sprained ankle. He averages 6.4 points a game.
