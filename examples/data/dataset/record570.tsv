â€” Miami guard Goran Dragic has been assessed a technical foul and fined $2,000 for swinging at Toronto guard Cory Joseph under the basket late in the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

The NBA announced the ruling Wednesday after a review.

"It was just a physical play," Dragic told reporters Wednesday. "I was trying to get a rebound and he was holding my arm. I kind of tried to let it go. I swung it a bit but there was no contact, nothing."

Joseph wasn't biting on the incident Wednesday before Game 5.

"Ah, I got nothing to say. I'm just focused on tonight," he said.

The series is tied 2-2.
