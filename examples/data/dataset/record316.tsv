Mavericks forward David Lee has left a game against San Antonio with a right foot injury and won't return.

Lee was replaced early in the second quarter in the regular-season finale Wednesday night. Dallas was already without guards J.J. Barea (right groin strain) and Devin Harris (left thumb sprain).

The Mavericks signed Lee shortly after the trading deadline in February after the 11th-year player reached a buyout agreement with Boston. He was traded the Celtics in the offseason after winning the NBA title with Golden State last season.

Dallas will open the playoffs this weekend after clinching a spot with a win at Utah on Monday.

Lee averaged 8.8 points and 7.1 rebounds in 24 games with the Mavericks before the finale.
