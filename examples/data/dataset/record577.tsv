â€” Golden State's Shaun Livingston was ejected in the second quarter of Game 4 of the Warriors' playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.

Livingston argued a no-call under the basket before he was tossed by referee Scott Foster for getting two technical fouls with 1:36 left before halftime.

The 12-year veteran guard was averaging 10.3 points and 6.7 assists in the playoffs. He had started six of the eight playoff games while Stephen Curry nursed a sprained right knee sustained in the first round against the Houston Rockets.

The Warriors led the Trail Blazers 2-1 in the Western Conference semifinals. Curry returned from the injury and had 11 points in 13:18 in the first half.
