Thunder guard Dion Waiters' younger brother has died, and Waiters has left the team to be with family.

Demetrius Pinckney was killed Tuesday in Philadelphia, and Waiters will not play Wednesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers.

Thunder general manager Sam Presti said Waiters and his family "are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time." Thunder forward Kevin Durant said it is "tough for anyone to go through that."

It was the third tragedy the Thunder have dealt with this season. Assistant coach Monty Williams' wife, Ingrid, was killed last month in a car crash in Oklahoma City, and part-owner Aubrey McClendon died last week in a one-car accident in Oklahoma City.

Waiters is averaging 12.2 points as a reserve.
