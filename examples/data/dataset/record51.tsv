Cavaliers point guard Mo Williams will be sidelined for at least the next two weeks with an injured left knee.

Williams has been bothered by soreness in his knee for much of the season. He did not travel with the team for weekend losses at Toronto and Washington.

Coach Tyronn Lue said before Monday's game against Indiana that Williams will be re-evaluated "in a couple weeks."

Williams' playing time has reduced dramatically in the past two months. He began the season in Cleveland's starting lineup while Kyrie Irving recovered from offseason knee surgery. Williams has not played more than 20 minutes in a game since Dec. 11.

Last week, Williams visited famed orthopedist Dr. James Andrews, who diagnosed chondromalacia, irritation under the kneecap.

Williams is averaging 8.9 points and 19.7 minutes.

Also, Lue has juggled his lineup, starting Timofey Mozgov at center instead of Tristan Thompson.
