The injury-decimated New Orleans Pelicans have received a hardship exemption from the NBA allowing them to increase their roster to 17 players and have signed forward Jordan Hamilton to a 10-day contract.

The 6-foot-7 Hamilton last played in the NBA Development League for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, averaging 14.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 14 games.

Hamilton is a former Texas Longhorns standout who was drafted 26th overall by Dallas in 2011.

Hamilton has played in the NBA in stints with Denver, Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers.

He has averaged 5.5 points and 2.6 rebounds in 12.8 minutes in 140 career NBA games.

Five Pelicans players, including All-Star forward Antony Davis, have had season-ending injuries. Three others have missed recent games with injuries sidelining them day-to-day.
