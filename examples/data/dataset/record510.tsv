â€” Portland Trail Blazers guard Gerald Henderson and Golden State Warriors reserve center Anderson Varejao were ejected late in the third quarter of Sunday's Game 1 in the Western Conference semifinals after getting into it for a second time and receiving two technical fouls.

With 15.1 seconds remaining in the third, Henderson was standing in the corner near the Warriors' bench after Varejao had been subbed out of the game. The two continued jawing and were hit with their second technicals for automatic ejections.

A few minutes earlier, at the 3:29 mark of the third, Varejao tripped Henderson after they collided and the Portland guard jumped up, pointing a finger at his opponent's face. After a review, they both got Ts.
