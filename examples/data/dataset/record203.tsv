Kristaps Porzingis will not play in the Knicks' game against Brooklyn because of a strained right shoulder that could end his rookie season.

Interim coach Kurt Rambis says the starting forward is day to day with six games remaining, but adds Friday that he and the medical staff would have to agree that Porzingis could safely play without fearing further injury.

Rambis says it would be "ridiculous of us as an organization" to play Porzingis if he wasn't healthy enough.

The No. 4 pick in the draft has averaged 14.3 points in 72 games, all starts. He didn't play Wednesday against Dallas after injuring the shoulder at New Orleans two days earlier.

Also, starting point guard Jose Calderon is out with a deep thigh bruise and Rambis says he will be out for a while.
