— Damian Lillard was right.

His Trail Blazers definitely were not fun to play Tuesday night. Not with the way they charged out of the locker room to match Golden State's will from two days earlier. Or the way they built a 17-point lead in the second quarter and then batted away surge after surge by the champion Warriors most of the rest of the way.

Lillard said it clear and with certainty through the chest cold that followed him into these Western Conference semifinals, now occasional coughs, and while still under the piano that had just been dropped cartoon style on the Blazers. It came screaming down from somewhere high above the Oracle Arena court in a fourth quarter they won't soon forget for the pain of realizing what had slipped through their fingers.

The 11-point lead entering the final period had become an 11-point loss to Golden State, and with it the chance at a 1-1 series had become an 0-2 deficit. The very promising start to Game 2 had been replaced by the hollow feel of shooting 26.3 percent the fateful final 12 minutes while being outscored 34-12, and, well, falling piano.

"I think any loss in the playoffs is a tough loss, but tonight especially because we were in control of the game," Lillard said. "We had an opportunity to steal one on the road. Things were going our way. We made shots, we played team ball. We really played hard defensively. We were playing a great game.

"I think nights like tonight, they suck," Lillard said. "It hurts to go back in the locker room after you play so well for so long and you come back in there with the L. But it is a part of growth. The entire season has been growth for us. But nights like tonight, we have to close that out. We have to get that done. It was just a missed opportunity."

Nights like this, man. Nights like this.

Golden State 110, Portland 99 was the moment that will forever make these Trail Blazers cringe, especially the fourth quarter. But they must live. Every emerging team that goes on to grand success has to endure some version of being carted out of the building toes up in disbelief at what just happened. As much as they are the worse for it, in an 0-2 hole and understanding the Warriors may improve if Stephen Curry returns from a sprained knee ligament as the series shifts to Portland on Saturday and Monday, the Blazers will actually be better for it.

Maybe even right away. They will be energized by the return to the Moda Center, motivated by what happened Monday and comforted by the memory of beating the Clippers in a Game 3 of similar circumstances in the first round. There is the obvious difference -- these are the Warriors, not the Clippers, who could never really be trusted even at full strength -- but there is also the confidence that comes from a season of resiliency.

Saturday and Monday at home will only be the latest test in that case, after going from 11-20 just before Christmas all the way to 44-38 and No. 5 in the West and then from 0-2 against the Clippers to a series win. Whenever the Trail Blazers go, as they reminded Monday, it will not be meekly, a loud, positive statement for their future with another summer of roster building.

It's just that Game 2 against the Warriors was their chance to do something bigger than ever about the present. And then it was gone. Even the Blazers knew they missed a special opportunity, to win in Oakland, which visiting teams almost never do, by out-playing and out-efforting Golden State.

"Definitely," Lillard said. "The game was winding down and I was just like, 'Man, this was a perfect opportunity.' We played how we talked about wanting to play on film. We played hungry, we played physical. We did it together.

"We were not fun to play against tonight defensively or offensively," Lillard said. "It wasn't easy what we went out there and did, but I think it was maybe six minutes left. At that point, that's when you've got to man up... and get it done. You've got to scratch and claw and whatever is necessary. You've got to go out there and do it. And I think that's where Golden State separated themselves. They became the championship team and we started to kind of do things that wasn't going to give us a chance to win the game. That was the difference in the game."

Game lost.

Opportunity lost.

"Well, yes and no," Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. "I mean, we played three really good quarters, and we showed that we can compete with them, and it got away from us in the fourth quarter, obviously. It was disappointing to lose a game that you're competitive and you're in a position to be in the fourth quarter. But we've got to close it out. It was an opportunity to get a win on the road, and we've got to learn from it and be ready to go get one in Game 3."

It is something the Blazers have to go through to steel themselves for the future that will get even brighter if the smart, aggressive front office adds a rim protector and/or scoring at forward at center. Not that it will be a fun memory, but it can be beneficial moving forward. Nights like this can.
