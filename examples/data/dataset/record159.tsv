Lakers rookie guard D'Angelo Russell was carried off the court Friday night after spraining his right ankle.

Russell was hurt late in the first half of Los Angeles' home game against Denver.

The Lakers say X-rays are negative on Russell, the No. 2 pick in last summer's draft. He will be re-evaluated this weekend.

Russell appeared to be making a normal defensive move when he rolled his ankle and immediately went down in pain. Jordan Clarkson and Tarik Black carried him off the court with his arms around their shoulders, unable to put weight on his foot.

The Lakers later announced Russell has a moderate sprain.

Russell is the NBA's fourth-leading scorer among rookies with 13.3 points per game, and he ranks third with 3.5 assists.
