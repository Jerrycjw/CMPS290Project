The Cavaliers don't know who they'll play next in the NBA playoffs, but they know when they'll play.

After sweeping eighth-seeded Detroit in the first round, Cleveland has a full week to rest up before its next game. The NBA announced on Monday that the Cavs will host Game 1 against either Boston or Atlanta on May 2. The series between the Celtics and Hawks is tied at two games apiece. Game 5 is Tuesday night in Atlanta.

The Cavs completed their four-game sweep of the Pistons on Sunday night with a 100-98 win.

Kyrie Irving, who broke his kneecap in the NBA Finals last year against Golden State and missed the first two months of this season following surgery, scored 31 points in Game 4. He averaged 27.5 points and shot 47 percent on 3-pointers in the opening-round series.
