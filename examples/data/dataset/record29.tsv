Former NBA All-Star Baron Davis is attempting a comeback, starting with the Philadelphia 76ers' developmental league team.

Davis signed with the Delaware 87ers on Wednesday. The 6-foot-3, 215-pound Davis hasn't played since the 2011-12 season because of a variety of injuries.

Davis was the No. 3 overall selection in the 1999 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He made two All-Star teams, one All-NBA selection and averaged 16.1 points and 7.2 assists over 835 career games.

Davis should play for Delaware on Friday night.
