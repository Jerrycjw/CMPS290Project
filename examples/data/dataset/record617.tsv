â€” The Portland Trail Blazers and head coach Terry Stotts have agreed to a contract extension, president of basketball operations Neil Olshey announced today. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

"Terry has been an outstanding partner and this extension represents our desire to build a model of stability and consistency," said Olshey.

Stotts completed his fourth season as head coach of the Trail Blazers in 2015-16, going 44-38 to solidify his third consecutive winning season and third straight postseason berth, despite not returning four of five starters from 2014-15. Portland defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs to advance to the Western Conference Semifinals for the second time in the past three seasons.

"I am very pleased that we were able to agree on a contract extension and look forward to continuing the progress that we have made," said Stotts. "As an organization, we have developed a culture and continuity that is exciting to be a part of, and I could not be more appreciative of the players and coaching staff.

"There is not a better fan base in the NBA. Jan and I love Portland and are extremely happy to call it our home."

Runner-up for the 2015-16 NBA Coach of the Year award, Stotts was named the NBA's Western Conference Coach of the Month in February of 2016 after the Trail Blazers finished the month with a 9-2 record.

In 2013-14, Stotts led the Trail Blazers to a 54-win season, marking the largest improvement in franchise history and the sixth-best record all-time. Portland won its first playoff series in 14 seasons, defeating the Houston Rockets in six games.

A 21-year coaching veteran, Portland introduced Stotts as the franchise's 14th head coach on August 7, 2012. He has compiled a 182-146 (.555) record in four seasons at the helm in Portland, good for fifth-most wins in team history, and has a 297-314 (.486) overall NBA coaching record with Atlanta, Milwaukee and Portland.
