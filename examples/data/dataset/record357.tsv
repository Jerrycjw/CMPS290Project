Kevin Durant says he's happy new Washington coach Scott Brooks is back in the NBA a year after being let go by Oklahoma City.

That doesn't mean Durant is - or isn't - heading to Washington.

When asked about the theory the Wizards hired Brooks to lure him closer to home in free agency this summer, Durant said, "I ain't really into theories. I'm focused on the Mavericks."

The Thunder star said Friday Brooks is a "great coach, someone that I really got to know and appreciate."

Brooks was hired in Oklahoma City in 2008 when the franchise moved from Seattle after Durant's rookie year. They spent seven seasons together and made five trips to the playoffs.
