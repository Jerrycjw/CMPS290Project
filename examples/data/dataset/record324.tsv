As Kobe Bryant makes the last stop of his storied 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, a downtown train station will be part of the citywide celebration.

The Pico Station on Metro's Blue and Expo rail lines will for a day become the Kobe Station.

The station is the Metro stop for Staples Center, the arena two blocks away where the 37-year-old Bryant will play his last game before retirement Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz.

A Metro spokesman says workers will change the signs at the station to bear Kobe's name starting at 6 a.m.
