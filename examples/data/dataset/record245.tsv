The Phoenix Suns say guard Brandon Knight has undergone surgery to treat a sports hernia.

The team said in a news release that the surgery was performed Thursday in Philadelphia by Dr. William Meyers. The Suns said Knight has begun rehabilitation and is to return to Phoenix next week.

Injuries limited Knight to 52 games this season but he averaged a career-high 19.6 points for a Phoenix team that, at 21-58, has the third worst record in the NBA. The Suns have been without guard Eric Bledsoe since he underwent knee surgery in late December.
