Sacramento Kings star center DeMarcus Cousins was scratched from the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night with a bruised right knee.

Cousins was listed as questionable for the game going in, but declared out by coach George Karl earlier in the day. Cousins has cemented himself as one of the best big men in the NBA, averaging 27.1 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists to carry the Kings.

Veteran backup Kosta Koufos was inserted into the starting lineup in place of Cousins, who missed a chance to play against fellow Kentucky Wildcat Karl-Anthony Towns.

Rajon Rondo was able to play while dealing with several ailments and Willie Cauley-Stein (flu) was active for the game.
