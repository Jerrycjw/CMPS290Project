The Brooklyn Nets have signed guard Sean Kilpatrick to a multiyear contract.

Kilpatrick has averaged 11.9 points in nine games since signing his first of two 10-day contracts on Feb. 28. He has scored in double figures in four straight games and is shooting 47 percent from 3-point range.

Players can sign two consecutive 10-day contracts, and then teams must sign them for the rest of the season if they want to keep them.

Terms of the deal announced Saturday were not disclosed.
