The NBA said Friday that Houston's James Harden should have been given an offensive foul for pushing Golden State's Andre Iguodala before his winning shot Thursday night in Game 3 of the first-round playoff series.

The Rockets trailed by a point when Harden dribbled down the court and pushed Iguodala before stepping back for the shot with 2.7 seconds left that gave Houston a 97-96 win and cut the Rockets' series deficit to 2-1.

The finding was announced in the NBA's report on the final two minutes. The report also found four other incorrect calls in the last two minutes, including the failure to call a foul on Golden State's Draymond Green when he threw Michael Beasley to the ground as Houston was inbounding the ball with a second remaining.

Game 4 of the best-of-seven series is Sunday in Houston.
