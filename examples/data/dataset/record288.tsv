Ties among teams that finished the 2015-16 NBA regular season with identical records were broken today through random drawings to help determine the order of selection for NBA Draft 2016 presented by State Farm, which will be held on Thursday, June 23.

The drawings were conducted live on NBA TV earlier Friday in New York City by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations. The tiebreak process was overseen by Denise Pelli, a representative from the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.

>> Dallas (42-40) won a tiebreaker with Memphis.

>> Detroit (44-38) won a tiebreaker with Portland.

>> Atlanta (48-34) won a tiebreaker with Boston, Charlotte and Miami; Charlotte then won a tiebreaker with Boston and Miami; Boston then won a tiebreaker with Miami.

With respect to the tie between the Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks and Sacramento Kings (33 and 49; 0.402 pct.): since the order of selection in the first round for this set of teams may change based on the results of the Draft Lottery, the order of selection in the second round cannot be determined until after the Draft Lottery is conducted (on May 17, 2016).
