Celtics coach Brad Stevens says reserve forward Evan Turner is continuing to recover from a left eye abrasion and will sit out when they host the Pelicans on Wednesday.

Turner spent Tuesday at home resting and did not attend Boston's practice. He was hurt in the closing seconds of Boston's win over the Lakers on Sunday.

Turner had scored eight of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. He started in place of Avery Bradley, who was out for personal reasons.

Stevens said Turner would be day to day, but that he is hopeful he can return Friday when the Celtics host Milwaukee.

Boston will be trying to improve its playoff seeding during its final five regular-season games.
