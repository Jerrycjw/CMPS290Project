Stephen Curry is out for the Golden State Warriors' game Tuesday night against Atlanta with an injured left ankle.

Coach Steve Kerr was leaning toward sitting Curry after he hurt his ankle Saturday night at Oklahoma City before returning to hit the long 3-pointer to win it in overtime. Curry's ankle became worse Sunday and he said it wasn't worth risking playing on it if it would mean setting himself back further.

Curry has three straight 40-point games. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday for his fourth such honor this season - he's the first in franchise history to win four in one season. He averaged 43.8 points, 7.3 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals while the Warriors went 4-0.

Kerr planned to start Shaun Livingston in Curry's place.

Andre Iguodala also was sidelined while dealing with tightness in his left hamstring.
