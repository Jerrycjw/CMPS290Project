Brook Lopez is out of the lineup for the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night against Detroit because of a virus.

It's only the second game Lopez has missed this season. The 7-foot center is averaging 20.6 points and 8.0 rebounds.

The Nets came into the game having lost seven of nine. Lopez scored only nine points in a 118-102 loss to Chicago on Thursday night.
