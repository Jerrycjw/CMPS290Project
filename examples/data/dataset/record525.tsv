â€” Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said star guard Stephen Curry will not play in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinal series against the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday night.

Curry has been sidelined since he sprained his right knee in Game 4 of the first round against Houston.

Curry returned to practice Friday and there was speculation the reigning MVP might play, but Kerr was emphatic in the pregame media availability.

"He's doing fine. He's not going to play tonight," Kerr said, adding with a smile: "I'll pause for tweets."

The Warriors lead the series 2-0. Kerr would not yet speculate on Curry's availability for Game 4 on Monday night.

Kerr also said that Curry hasn't asked to be put back in the lineup - yet.

"I image that's coming soon," Kerr said.
