â€” The Milwaukee Bucks say their organization inadvertently provided tax information of employees, including players, to someone who was impersonating the team's president over email.

The Bucks said Thursday that the "security incident" involving the W-2 forms of all 2015 employees was reported to the IRS and FBI after being discovered earlier this week. The team says it arranged for employees to have access to credit monitoring and identity restoration services.

The tax information was provided by a Bucks worker before it was determined that the request came from a "spoofed email address" for team president Peter Feigin. The Bucks say the mistake was the result of human error, and that they were providing additional privacy training to staff and implementing additional preventative measures.
