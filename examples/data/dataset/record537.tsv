More than 70 players have been invited to the 2016 NBA Draft Combine, an event that begins May 11 and runs through May 15 in Chicago.

A new rule that applies to this year's Draft allows players to go through the predraft process all the way through the combine. Players who haven't signed with agents have 10 days (May 25) after the combine to withdraw from the Draft.
