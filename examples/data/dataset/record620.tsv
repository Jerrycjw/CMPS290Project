â€” The Minnesota Timberwolves will send Karl-Anthony Towns as their representative to the NBA draft lottery, hoping for the same fortune that brought them the NBA Rookie of the Year.

The Wolves took Towns with the first pick in 2015 after winning the lottery last spring. This time, they'll have 88 pingpong balls in the hopper out of 1,000 for an 8.8 percent chance of landing the top spot again. The draw will take place Tuesday night in New York.

Towns will wear one of the late Flip Saunders' wedding rings around his neck as a good-luck charm at the suggestion of Saunders' son, Ryan, who wears it around his neck each day.

Saunders, the former coach and executive of the Wolves, died last October after a battle with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
