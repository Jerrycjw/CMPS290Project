The Chicago Bulls got the news they anticipated after orthopedist Dr. James Andrews found no structural damage in All-Star guard Jimmy Butler's injured left knee.

Butler was examined Thursday in Pensacola, Florida.

The team says Andrews "gave a confirmatory opinion and supports the current management of Butler's condition." He was scheduled to work out Thursday but sit out the game at San Antonio.

The Bulls placed no timetable on his return.

Butler sat out Monday's win over Milwaukee because of swelling in the same knee that had sidelined him for 11 games. He had returned to score 24 points while playing 34 minutes in Saturday's win over Houston but experienced stiffness in his back the following day. He then developed swelling in his knee on Monday.
