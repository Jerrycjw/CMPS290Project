The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Jordan Farmar (FAHR-mahr) for the rest of this season.

The Grizzlies announced the move Thursday.

The 6-foot-2, 180-pound Farmar has started three of five games since signing a 10-day contract with Memphis on March 21, and he has averaged 10.8 points and 3.6 assists. Farmar, 29, has played in 495 games over nine seasons with the Lakers, Nets, Clippers and now the Grizzlies.

Farmar originally was the 26th draft selection by the Lakers in 2006 out of UCLA.

The Grizzlies have been without point guard Mike Conley since his last game March 6 because of Achilles tendinitis in his left foot. They currently hold the No. 5 spot in the Western Conference with seven games remaining.
