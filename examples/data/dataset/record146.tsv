Wizards guard Bradley Beal is in the starting lineup for Washington's game against the Detroit Pistons.

His return Monday night comes after missing three games with a sprained pelvis, the latest setback in an injury-filled season.

Beal also missed a stretch of 16 games in December and January with a stress reaction in his right leg. The fourth-year guard is averaging 17.8 points per game and is the Wizards' second-leading scorer.

Washington enters Monday in 10th place in the Eastern Conference, 3 1/2 games behind Detroit for the conference's eighth and final playoff spot.
