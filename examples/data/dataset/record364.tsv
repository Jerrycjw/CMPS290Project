Indiana Pacers starting center Ian Mahinmi expects to play Thursday night when the Pacers and Toronto resume their first-round playoff series.

Following a morning shootaround in Indianapolis, Mahinmi told reporters that his sore back was feeling better and he would "be good to go." A few minutes later, coach Frank Vogel said Mahinmi did not participate in contact drills and was questionable for Game 3.

The recurring injury forced Mahinmi to leave Monday night's game early as the Raptors evened the best-of-seven series at 1-1.

Toronto coach Dwane Casey said Terrence Ross will be available Thursday. He went through the concussion protocol after getting knocked down in the first half Monday and complaining of a headache.
