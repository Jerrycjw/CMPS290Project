Golden State starting center Andrew Bogut will not play in the Warriors' game at San Antonio on Saturday night because of a foot injury.

Golden State, which has lost 32 straight regular-season games in San Antonio, was already without key reserves Andre Iguodala (sprained left ankle) and Festus Ezeli (left knee surgery).

Bogut strained his left big toe Friday night in a 130-112 victory in Dallas. Bogut had two points and two rebounds in nine minutes.

Golden State has not won in San Antonio since Feb. 14, 1997, but walloped the Spurs 120-90 on Jan. 25 at the Oracle Arena in the first showdown between the league's two most dominant teams.

Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said everyone is available for San Antonio.

The Warriors (62-6) hold a four-game lead over the Spurs (58-10) for the league's top seed with a month remaining in the regular season. They will meet again April 7 at Golden State and April 10 in San Antonio.

San Antonio has won 43 straight home games dating to last season, which is one shy of matching the 1995-96 Bulls for the second-longest streak in league history. Golden State is currently on a 50-game home winning streak dating to January 2015.

The New York Knicks hold the record for road futility, losing 43 straight to the Los Angeles Lakers from 1975-92.
