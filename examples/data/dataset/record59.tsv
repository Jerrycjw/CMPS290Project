Los Angeles Clippers forward Branden Dawson was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of spousal abuse.

Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera said the 23-year-old player was taken into custody around 7:30 a.m. at a residence in the Playa Vista area, where the team's practice facility is located on the city's westside.

He was released on $50,000 bail about six hours later. Herrera didn't immediately know if Dawson had an attorney.

"It's an awful situation," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "I have a daughter."

Dawson has appeared in two games for the Clippers this season, averaging 1.0 point and 1.5 rebounds. Rivers said it was too early to discuss possible team punishment for him.

Dawson was recalled from the Erie (Pennsylvania) BayHawks of the NBA's D-League on Saturday. He last played for them in a road game in Maine on Thursday night.

After his arrest, he wasn't with the Clippers for Sunday's nationally televised home game against Cleveland.

It was Dawson's fourth D-League assignment and his first in Erie this season. He averaged 19.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.2 steals in six games for the BayHawks. His other D-League stints were in Bakersfield, California, and Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Dawson, of Gary, Indiana, attended Michigan State, where he played four seasons and helped the Spartans reach the Final Four as a senior. He was drafted in the second round by the Clippers last summer.
