San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard left the Spurs' game against the Miami Heat midway through the third quarter Wednesday night after suffering a bruised right quadriceps.

Leonard matched a career high with 32 points on 12-for-21 shooting before leaving with 6:01 remaining in the third quarter.

Leonard left after making a free throw to complete a three-point play after being fouled on a driving layup by Justise Winslow. The All-Star forward went to the locker room following the free throw, followed closely by Spurs trainer Will Sevening.

San Antonio was leading Miami by as many as 29 points in its bid for a 36th straight home victory to open the season, which would put the Spurs a game shy of the record set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96.
