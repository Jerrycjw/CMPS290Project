Carmelo Anthony is missing the Knicks' game against Sacramento on Sunday night because of a migraine.

Anthony was bothered by a migraine during a loss in Washington on Saturday and was still experiencing symptoms Sunday and having trouble with lights. Interim coach Kurt Rambis originally said the Knicks' leading scorer would be a game-time decision, but the team officially ruled out him shortly after.

Arron Afflalo is starting for Anthony, who averages 21.8 points. The Knicks are 0-7 without Anthony this season.

New York also recalled forward Cleanthony Early, who hasn't played since getting shot in the right knee during a robbery on Dec. 30.
