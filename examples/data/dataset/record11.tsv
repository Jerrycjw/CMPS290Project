Much like our Kia MVP Ladder, the OSPR is looking more and more like a one-horse race.

That's bound to happen when you're a 7-footer putting up numbers usually reserved for elite shooting guards and small forwards.

No one may be bumping the king from his mountain, but there's still some movement right under him, including a familiar name finally making the ascension into the top three. As for the bottom half of the list, we'll play nice and just say 'no comment.'

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 3. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 4 games, 16.3 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 6.0 apg

Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 3.8 apg

As was the case in Week 14, one look at last week's numbers and you see why Gasol is widening his lead on the field. Yes, he shot just 40.6 from the field and has gone consecutive games with fewer than 10 rebounds after three straight with 15 or more, but how can you not be impressed with Saturday's triple-double: 22 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists. For good measure, Gasol added three blocks.

Gasol's Triple-Double Pau Gasol notches a triple-double scoring 22 points with 16 boards and 14 dimes versus Portland.

2. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 4 games, 22.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 5.8 apg

Season stats: 19.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg

It was another solid week for Wade, who has now secured seven or more assists in three of the last five games and 18 or more points in five straight. It looks like adding Joe Johnson to the lineup hasn't disrupted the offense -- or Wade's game. It might be an even more productive week coming up, as Wade faces the 76ers twice, the Bucks and the Bulls.

Heat vs. Knicks Dwyane Wade scores 26 points with 7 rebounds as the Heat beat the Knicks 98-81 on Sunday night.

3. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: 4 games, 18.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.5 apg

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.7 apg

It wasn't a spectacular week for Randolph, but it was good enough to be just the third player to disrupt the Big Three of Gasol, Wade and Nowitzki (Jamal Crawford in Week 13 and Tony Parker in Week 2). Despite a dip in rebounding, the scoring remained consistent, managing 19 or more in three of four. For good measure, Randolph went 20-for-20 from the free-throw line.

4. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.7 ppg, 1.3 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 14.0 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.1 apg

It's quite amazing what Crawford can do offensively when you factor in his playing time. Last week, Crawford averaged just under 20 points while playing 27.8 minutes per game. That translates to a whopping 33.9 points per 48 minutes. If given 30 minutes per game (he's averaging 26.6 this season), would Crawford average 20 points?

Nets vs. Clippers Jamal Crawford heats up for 26 points off the bench as the Clippers beat the Nets 105-95 on Monday night.

5. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 4 games, 16.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 17.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.7 apg

Is it slip-slidding-away time for Nowitzki? After all, this is his lowest standing on the OSPR all season. It's not as though he played terribly, just the other two played better. We expect the big German to rebound quickly, but he'll need to put together a string of solid games in order to jump over Randolph and/or Crawford.

6. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 8

Last week's stats: 17.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 11.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 4.0 apg

This is the spot on the list where things get a bit ugly since no one did anything to warrant moving up, which of course means Johnson makes the climb by default. He seems to have taken nicely to his new surroundings in Miami, shooting 60 percent from the field and 62.5 from beyond the arc. Equally nice is the fact the Heat are a perfect 3-0 with Johnson.

Johnson's First Points With Heat Joe Johnson finds the bottom of the net for his first points with the Miami Heat.

7. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 3 games, 9.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.1 apg

After his big leap in Week 14, Parker slipped a bit. He shot 50 percent from the field, but Thursday's two-point performance against the Pelicans put an end to a string of seven straight games with double-figure scoring. He's also gone three straight with less than six assists.

8. Matt Barnes (35), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 9

Last week's stats: 4 games, 8.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 9.0 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 1.9 apg

Two good games, two bad ones. We've seen this before from Barnes, who shot just 36.4 from the field and 17.6 (3-for-17) from beyond the arc. In his two bad outings, Barnes combined for two points on 1-for-11 shooting. In two good showings, he managed to average 16.0 points and 5.5 rebounds on 11-for-22 shooting.

9. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 1 game, 5.0 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 4.1 apg, 3.2 apg

Bryant, who has been limited because of recurring soreness in his right shoulder, played just 11 minutes last week and goes into this week questionable. Maybe that shoulder is still recovering from that two-game stretch in which he put up 45 shots. Injury or not, another week like this and Bryant will be bumped from the list.

10. Mike Dunleavy (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.3 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 8.5 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.4 apg

We realize last week's stats leave a lot to be desired, but there weren't any better choices out there. Trust us. Dunleavy, who is seeing a steady amount of minutes (25.9 last week), shot 41.2 (7-for-17) from beyond the arc, connecting on two or more 3s in three of four games and has now nailed at least one trey in eight straight.

Just missed the cut: Amar'e Stoudemire, Jason Terry, Vince Carter
