The Milwaukee Bucks have used the NBA's hardship exception to sign guard Jared Cunningham to a 10-day contract, an addition that replenishes the team's injury-ravaged backcourt.

General manager John Hammond announced the signing on Wednesday. Cunningham most recently played for Idaho in the NBA Developmental League.

The 6-foot-4 Cunningham also appeared in 40 games this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging 2.6 points in 8.9 minutes a game before being traded on Feb. 18 to Orlando, where he was waived.

Cunningham was drafted in 2012 in the first round with the 24th pick by the Cavaliers out of Oregon State.

The Bucks have lost guards Michael Carter-Williams and O.J. Mayo to season-ending injuries in recent weeks. Guard Greivis Vasquez hasn't played since late November following right ankle surgery.
