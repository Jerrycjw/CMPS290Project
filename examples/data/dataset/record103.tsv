The Memphis Grizzlies will play their next two games without guard Mike Conley and center Chris Andersen because of injuries, and the duo will be re-evaluated within the next five days.

The Grizzlies announced Monday that Andersen dislocated his left shoulder in the second quarter of Sunday's loss to Phoenix, while Conley has soreness in his left foot.

Conley and Andersen will miss both Monday night's game at Cleveland and Wednesday's game at Boston.

The Grizzlies already are without center Marc Gasol who had surgery last month to repair a broken navicular bone in his right foot.

Conley is averaging 15.3 points and a team-high 6.1 assists in 56 starts this season. Andersen is averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds in his 16 games this season with Memphis and Miami.
