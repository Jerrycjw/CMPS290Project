The Delaware 87ers on Wednesday announced the team has acquired former NBA All-Star Baron Davis from the available player pool.

"Our organizational efforts continue to center on finding, developing, and providing opportunity to talented professionals," said Philadelphia 76ers Chief of Staff and Delaware 87ers General Manager, Brandon D. Williams. "Baron still has much to contribute to the game, and we are excited to play a role as he transitions through the next phase of his successful career."

The 6-foot-3, 215 pound guard most recently played for the New York Knicks during the 2011-12 season, where he appeared in 29 games, averaging 6.1 points and 4.7 assists in 20.5 minutes per game. Davis, a two-time NBA All-Star and former All-NBA selection, has 835 NBA games on his resume, with career averages of 16.1 points, 7.2 assists and 3.8 rebounds in 34.2 minutes per game.

A two-year starter at the University of California, Los Angeles, Davis was the No. 3 overall selection in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets.

The 87ers next home game is Friday, March 4, with tip scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark.
