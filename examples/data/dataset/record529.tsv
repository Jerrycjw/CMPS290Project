â€” The NBA and GE Healthcare have awarded more than $1.5 million in funding to six groups researching injury prevention.

The winners were chosen from a group of nearly 70 proposals focusing on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tendinopathy - pain in and around tendons - specifically the patellar tendon.

Two teams from the University of Calgary, as well as groups from La Trobe University in Australia, the University of Wisconsin, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, and Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands were the winners, the league announced Friday.

The NBA and GE Healthcare partnered last summer to fund research to prevent musculoskeletal injuries, affecting muscles, nerves, tendons, joints and cartilage, and caused or prolonged by physical factors such as force and repetition.

The next call for proposals will focus on areas such as hamstring and calf injuries.
