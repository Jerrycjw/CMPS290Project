Celtics center Kelly Olynyk will miss his second straight game with a sore right shoulder, while the Hawks remained hopeful that backup point guard Dennis Schroder would available for the Game 3 after spraining his left ankle.

Boston coach Brad Stevens said before the game Friday night that Olynyk was "feeling a little bit better" but was having some shifting issues in his shoulder and still in a fair amount of pain. He also did not participate in a pregame shoot around or walkthrough.

Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said Schroder's ankle was fine after flying from Atlanta, and that he was generally unrestricted during most of the Atlanta's morning walkthrough. Schroder injured the ankle near the end of the Hawks' Game 2 win in Atlanta.

Stevens also announced a pair of changes to his starting lineup. He said Evan Turner would start in place of Marcus Smart and that Jonas Jerebko would start for Jared Sullinger.
