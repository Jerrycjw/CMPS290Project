Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens says forward Kelly Olynyk is available for Sunday night's game against Atlanta.

Olynyk has missed the last two games of the first-round playoff series with a shoulder injury.

Stevens says he isn't sure how much Olynyk will play.

The Celtics need a win to tie the series 2-2 heading into Game 5 on Tuesday in Atlanta.
