Four fans trying to get an autograph from Stephen Curry fell out of the stands when a railing dislodged before the Utah Jazz hosted the Golden State Warriors.

Curry had just finished his pregame routine, which draws many fans at Warriors games, when he stopped to take a picture and sign a few autographs at the opening of the tunnel.

A large number of fans lined the stands surrounding the tunnel, holding jerseys and other paraphernalia for Curry to sign. As he did, a railing dislodged and four fans, including three minors, fell onto the floor at Curry's feet.

One fan went to first aid on his own and the other three were treated, released and returned to their seats.

Curry autographed an item for the three fans that did not leave the scene.

Jazz spokesman Frank Zang said the team will re-evaluate the safety measures around the court.
