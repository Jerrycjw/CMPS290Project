â€” Mark Cuban is picking the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the NBA's biggest prize.

The owner of the Dallas Mavericks gave a wide-ranging interview for NBC's "Meet The Press," and host Chuck Todd ended the sit-down by asking Cuban if he was picking Cleveland, Golden State or Oklahoma City to win the NBA title.

"You know, I'm going to take a little bit of a long shot here and go with the Thunder," Cuban said.

Toronto wasn't one of the options Todd presented to Cuban.

"I've already eliminated the Raptors," Todd said, though it bears noting that the interview with Cuban was taped before Toronto's win over Cleveland in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday night. The Cavs still lead that series, 2-1.

Basketball was a secondary topic in the interview, of course.

Cuban spoke on a number of non-NBA issues , including the likely presidential showdown between Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
