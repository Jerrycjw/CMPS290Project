â€” Heat center Hassan Whiteside has been ruled out of Monday's Game 4 of Miami's Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Toronto Raptors with a sprained ligament in his right knee.

Whiteside was hurt Saturday in Game 3. An MRI showed a sprain of his medial collateral ligament and the Heat listed him as day-to-day.

No determination has been made about Whiteside's availability for Game 5 in Toronto on Wednesday.

Toronto will also be without its center for Game 4. The Raptors said on Sunday that Jonas Valanciunas will miss the remainder of the series with a sprained right ankle.

Valanciunas was with the team for its shootaround practice Monday in a walking boot.
