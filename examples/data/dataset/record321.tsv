The Philadelphia 76ers are set to launch a lab designed to help local startup companies at their new training complex.

The Sixers will integrate a 10,000 square-foot innovation lab at their new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

Selected startups will have the opportunity to participate in core curriculum programs, including a speaker series and leadership training featuring executives from industry-leading companies. Each of the selected companies will receive sponsorships from the Philadelphia 76ers to assist with growing their business' marketing and customer base.

The Sixers will begin accepting applications on April 15 until the deadline on Sept. 30.

Participant companies will be vetted and selected by a board of governors, including Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O'Neil.

The Sixers expect their complex to open in time for the start of the 2016-17 season.
