The Brooklyn Nets have hired Trajan Langdon as assistant general manager.

The former Duke star had a successful international career playing for Russia's CSKA Moscow, owned by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. He has spent the past few seasons working for the Spurs and Cavaliers organizations.

He was a pro scout for San Antonio from 2012-15, where he worked with new Nets GM Sean Marks, and has been with Cleveland since September as director of player administration and basketball operations.

Marks was hired last month to replace Billy King and said he planned to expand the Nets' staff. He says Tuesday in a statement that Langdon "brings a unique combination of NBA and European experience to the position."
