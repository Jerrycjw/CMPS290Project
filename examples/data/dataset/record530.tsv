â€” Blake Griffin won't play for the U.S. basketball team this summer at its training camp, likely knocking him out of the Olympics for the second straight time.

Griffin had a bone marrow procedure on his left quad tendon on April 27, the Los Angeles Clippers said Friday. The forward has already begun rehabilitation and the team says he is expected to be ready for next season.

The Clippers said Griffin would miss the Americans' training camp and their five-game exhibition tour. Given that the 12-member team will be selected before camp, it's unlikely Griffin would be picked knowing he couldn't play.

Griffin was originally hurt Dec. 25, re-injured the quad in the playoffs and was limited to just 35 regular-season games and four in the postseason.

He had made the Olympic team in 2012 but was forced to withdraw after an injury in an exhibition game.
