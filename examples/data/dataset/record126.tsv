Sacramento guard Rajon Rondo returned to the lineup against Detroit after missing a game with a variety of injuries.

Rondo was sidelined Wednesday against New Orleans with turf toe, a thumb sprain and a right shoulder bruise. It was the fourth game he's missed this season.

Sacramento was without center Willie Cauley-Stein (illness) on Friday.
