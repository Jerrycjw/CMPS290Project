Charlotte Hornets forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Saturday night's Game 3 of their first-round series against the Miami Heat with a sprained left foot.

Miami leads the best-of-seven series 2-0, with the games shifting to Charlotte.

Batum underwent an MRI on Thursday. The team says Batum will continue to receive treatment and his status will be updated before Game 4 on Monday night.

Batum sustained the injury in the fourth quarter of Charlotte's Game 2 loss Wednesday night.

Batum averaged career highs of 14.9 points and 5.8 assists along with 6.1 rebounds in 35 minutes during the regular season. He's averaging 16.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists in the playoffs.
