The Spurs have signed 39-year-old guard Andre Miller four days after the oldest player on an NBA roster was waived by Minnesota.

The addition of Miller on Monday gives the Spurs the two oldest active players, according to STATS. Miller turns 40 on March 19, followed by Tim Duncan on April 25.

Miller had spent all season with the Timberwolves, his eighth team. The 17-year veteran averaged 3.4 points and 2.2 assists in 26 games.

The eighth overall pick by Cleveland in 1999, Miller has career averages of 12.6 points, 6.6 assists and 3.7 rebounds in 1,291 appearances, which ranks 20th on the career list. He is ninth in NBA history with 8,495 assists.

The Spurs also waived guard Ray McCallum.
