â€” Mavericks guard Devin Harris has had his left big toe and left thumb surgically repaired.

Harris had both surgeries Tuesday in New York. They were performed by different doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery.

The toe bothered Harris for much of the season, and he missed 10 consecutive games into early March. He had a bone problem fixed in the same foot three years ago.

During the playoffs, Harris played with his thumb heavily taped and coach Rick Carlisle said he had a torn ligament.

Harris averaged 7.6 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 64 games. It was his 12th NBA season.
