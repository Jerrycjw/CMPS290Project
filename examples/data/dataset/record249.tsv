Toronto Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll has returned from right knee surgery after missing 41 games.

Before getting hurt, Carroll averaged 11.7 and 4.8 rebounds in 23 games. Carroll, in the first season of a four-year, $60 million contract, entered the game in the second quarter.

Coach Dwane Casey said the Raptors want to "incorporate him in a little bit as we go in these last (five) games" of the regular season.

Toronto has secured no worse than the No. 2 playoff seed and began the night three games behind Cleveland in the Eastern Conference.

Carroll, a seventh-year veteran, had the best two seasons of his career playing for the Atlanta Hawks. Atlanta couldn't afford to keep him in free agency, choosing instead to re-sign All-Star forward Paul Millsap.
