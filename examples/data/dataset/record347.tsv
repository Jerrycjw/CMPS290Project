Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford says veteran Al Jefferson and rookie Frank Kaminsky will start Game 3 against the Miami Heat on Saturday night to give his lineup more height.

Marvin Williams will start at small forward for the injured Nicolas Batum, who is out with a strained left foot.

Kaminsky will step into Williams' spot at the four spot, while Jefferson will replace Cozy Zeller at center, giving the Hornets more experience on the floor.

The Hornets trail the Heat 2-0 in the first-round series.

Clifford said after watching film of the first two games - both losses at Miami - that "size has been an issue for us, particularly on the perimeter. By playing bigger hopefully we can have a better chance."
