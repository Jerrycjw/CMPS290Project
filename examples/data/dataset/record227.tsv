New Orleans Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday, who has missed two games with a toe injury on his left foot, is returning to the lineup for Monday night's game against the New York Knicks.

Coach Alvin Gentry says the injury is still nagging Holiday, but he's ready to "give it a go."

Holiday has scored 20 or more points in seven of his previous 10 games, including three games with at least 30. His play has been among the few bright spots for the injury-decimated Pelicans, who entered Monday with a 26-46 record.

Forward Ryan Anderson, who has missed four games with groin soreness in both legs, and guard Norris Cole, who has missed 10 games back soreness, remain out against the Knicks.
