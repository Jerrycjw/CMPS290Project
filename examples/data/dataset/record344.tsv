Mavericks guard Deron Williams' attempt to play through a sports hernia in Game 4 of a first-round series against Oklahoma City lasted less than 2 minutes.

Williams started Saturday night after missing Dallas' loss in Game 3. But he aggravated the injury while chasing a loose ball and running into the scorer's table just 40 seconds into the game.

The team officially listed the injury as a left abdominal strain. Williams came out of the game and went to the locker room with 10:31 left in the first quarter.

The 11-year veteran played a big role in the first half of the Mavericks' one-point win in Game 2, but he left in the third quarter and didn't return. Williams has said offseason surgery is possible.
