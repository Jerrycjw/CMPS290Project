â€” Dwyane Wade says he's feeling "all kinds of emotions" after hearing that he was Prince's favorite basketball player.

The Miami Heat star took to Twitter after hearing Prince's comments in a 2012 Australian radio interview the late pop icon conducted with model Damaris Lewis.

Wade tweeted that he knows he has fans and supporters around the world, but "hearing Prince say those words was an ultimate compliment."

Prince died last month at his Minnesota home at the age of 57.
