Stephen Curry said Friday that he'll be very surprised if his sprained right ankle keeps him out in Game 4 of the Golden State Warriors' first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

Curry was injured in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.

Last year's MVP was on the bench for Game 2, but watched from the locker room Thursday night because he didn't bring a suit to Houston. Though he's still listed as questionable for the next game, Curry sounded pretty confident that he wouldn't be on the bench again.

"I will not be going to any suit store," Curry said asked if he'd buy a suit in case he doesn't play Sunday.

Curry played a couple of games of 3-on-3 during practice Friday to test his ankle. Physically he felt good, but all wasn't well with the star and he answered this way when asked how his explosion and change of direction was in practice.

"Awful," he said. "It was just rusty. Got to get the flow and the mechanics and stuff. When you miss that time literally not doing anything it's tough."

He was happy to be back with his teammates and feels like his work on Friday was a positive step toward playing on Sunday. Curry will participate in a 5-on-5 scrimmage on Saturday and how he feels after that will be important in deciding if he can return in Game 4.

Curry said he respects and trusts the opinions of the team doctor and the Golden State training staff, but that it's difficult to listen to them when he wants to play so badly.

"I think I can play through a little bit of discomfort and whatnot, especially in a playoff situation," he said. "They kind of have the thought if there is any ounce of instability or doubt, to be on the more cautious side."

"So any player that loves to play the game and wants to take advantage of these opportunities in the playoffs is going to push to get out there. Obviously, they have my best interest, but it's kind of hard to take that advice and sit out. It's a tough feeling."
