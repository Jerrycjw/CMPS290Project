Rookie Kristaps Porzingis is sitting out the Knicks' game against Detroit because of a bruised lower left leg.

The Knicks made the announcement a little less than an hour before the start of Saturday's game. Porzingis walked by slowly with the team doctor a few minutes later, saying he was all right.

The No. 4 pick in the draft is the Knicks' second-leading scorer with 14 points per game. This was just the second game he missed this season.

He played 20 minutes Friday in a loss to Boston, finishing with 15 points.
