San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich is resting every starter except Tim Duncan against the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.

Popovich will sit LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and Tony Parker. Manu Ginobili also will be on the bench, along with Boris Diaw, who's dealing with a sore right adductor.

The night off comes on the heels of a loss Thursday at Golden State. Duncan didn't play big minutes against the Warriors, so he will be out there because Popovich wants to "keep him in shape," he explained.

Popovich plans to go with his regular rotation Sunday when the Spurs host the Warriors. And while San Antonio has won 48 straight regular-season games at home dating to last season, Popovich says the streak is "absolutely meaningless" to him.

Asked why, he said: "What does that get you if you're defeated? Does it win you anything? That's why it's meaningless."
