The NBA had a record-setting season in the stands and on the screens.

The league said Thursday it broke its attendance mark for the second straight season, drawing nearly 22 million fans in 2015-16.

The average attendance of 17,864 also was a record, including the 723 sellouts and 94 percent average arena capacity.

NBA TV had its most viewers this season as part of a year of growth for NBA Digital.

The network averaged 345,000 total viewers during the regular season, a 19 percent increase over 2014-15. It drew a record number of viewers for its April 10 tripleheader, highlighted by Golden State's victory over San Antonio in the nightcap.

That game drew an average of 2.6 million viewers, the most for a game on NBA TV.

NBA Digital also says NBA League Pass, NBA.com and the NBA App had increases in views, visits and downloads. It says the 9.1 billion video views on the website and app was a 160 percent increase over last season.
