The Oklahoma City Thunder are resting star Kevin Durant and starting forward Serge Ibaka for Tuesday night's game against the Detroit Pistons.

Coach Billy Donovan says the Thunder thought this was a good chance to rest the two players after Oklahoma City played at Toronto the previous night. The Thunder have clinched the Northwest Division title, and they are almost certain to end up with the Western Conference's third-best record at the end of the regular season.

Oklahoma City has won eight straight.

The Pistons catch a break with Durant and Ibaka out of the lineup. Detroit enters Tuesday night's game with a 2 1/2-game lead in the race for the final playoff spot in the East.
