In the end, it was a four-game stretch that decided things in the inaugural OSPR.

One guy came strong while the other opened the week nicely before taking his foot off the gas. To be king of the mountain, you've got to sprint through the finish line.

Meanwhile, a legend ready to walk off into the sunset turns in what may be his last 30-point game to keep a spot on the list. Also, a big man in the desert has a scorching week to close 2015-16 in nice position.

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 2 | Week 1 rank: 2

Last week's stats: 4 games, 17.5 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 3.8 apg

Season stats: 16.6 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 4.1 apg

It was a forgettable week for the Bulls (1-3), but not for Gasol. The Spaniard pocketed three double-doubles while shooting 51.9 from the field. He also managed 3.5 blocks, getting four blocks in three of four games. This comes after a stretch of eight games where Gasol went for more than two blocks just twice. And as we see below, he's still up to his old tricks.

2. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 1 | Week 1 rank: 1

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.7 apg

Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 1.7 apg

After starting the week with a 19-point effort against Detroit, Nowitzki basically pulled a no-show, combining for 20 points on 6-for-26 shooting over the next two games. For the week, Nowitzki shot just 31.8 from the field and a paltry 23.1 from beyond the arc, including an ugly 2-for-10 on Sunday. He also failed to snatch more than six rebounds in any game.

3. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 4 | Week 1 rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.3 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 4.7 apg

Season stats: 15.3 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 2.1 apg

How does Randolph move up a notch despite shooting just 40.4 from the field? By securing your first double-double (27 points, 10 rebounds on Tuesday) since March 21, a span of five games. It also helps when you score at least 15 points in your other two games. Despite nagging injuries, Randolph came on strong late, averaging 20.3 over his last seven games.

Randolph Drops 27 Zach Randolph scores 27 points with 10 boards to lead Memphis over Chicago.

4. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 3 | Week 1 rank: 3

Last week's stats: 2 games, 18.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 19.2 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.7 apg

After missing the first two games of the week with back and neck injuries, Wade delivered two games of 15-plus points. He also managed to shoot 50 percent from the field and added 1.5 steals. But it wasn't enough production to prevent Randolph from jumping ahead of him. Despite that, Wade still turned in a very productive season.

5. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 5 | Week 1 rank: 8

Last week's stats: 4 games, 13.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 4.5 apg

Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 4.0 apg

After a recent shooting slump, Johnson appears to have rediscovered his shot, managing 57.5 FG% and 41.7 3PT% -- though he never took more than 11 shots in any game last week. He's now gone for double-digit scoring five straight times after failing to eclipse that mark in four consecutive games.

6. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: Just missed | Week 1 rank: 10

Last week's stats: 4 games, 15.8 ppg, 14.0 rpg, 1.0 apg

Season stats: 7.1 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 1.0 apg

We gave serious thought to moving up Chandler into the top five. Why? Because he notched four double-doubles for the week to go along with 71.4 shooting. Chandler now has five straight double-doubles and has shot 50 percent or better in 28 straight games (hey, so what if some of those games were 1-for-2 or 2-for-4).

7. Matt Barnes (36), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 8 | Week 1 rank: NA

Last week's stats: 3 games, 14.0 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 9.9 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.1 apg

Let's get the ugly out of the way early. Barnes started the week Friday 1-for-7 for two points before registering two solid performances, highlighted by Sunday's 24-point effort against the Magic in which he nailed five 3-pointers. That was his highest scoring output since going for 26 points on March 11 against the Pelicans.

8. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 9 | Week 1 rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 19.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 0.7 apg

Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 2.8 apg

The shooting was horrific (32.2 FG% and 26.3 3PT%), much like it's been all season, but Bryant managed to ascend one spot on the strength of a 34-point effort against the Celtics on Sunday. It could turn out being the last 30-point game of his Hall of Fame career, so it's only fitting it came against longtime rival Boston.

9. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 7 | Week 1 rank: 6

Last week's stats: 2 games, 11.5 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 3.5 apg

Season stats: 13.9 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.3 apg

Crawford was consistent last week in terms of his shooting: 44.4 FG%, 44.4 3PT%. But after a solid 19-point performance against the Wizards on Sunday, Crawford fell flat, managing just four points on 2-for-6 shooting in 18 minutes. He also failed to hit a 3-pointer for just the second time in his last 11 games.

10. Vince Carter (39), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: NA | Week 1 rank: NA

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.3 apg

Season stats: 6.5 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

Three double-digit scoring games on the strength of 50 percent shooting, and 41.7 from beyond the arc, gets Carter back on the list to finish the season. What was most impressive is that he averaged 13.3 points in just 22.7 minutes. He's also gone five straight games with at least one made 3-pointer.
