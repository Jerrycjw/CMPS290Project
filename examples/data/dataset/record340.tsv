Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry will play on Sunday against the Houston Rockets in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series.

Curry sprained his right ankle in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.

Curry practiced with the team the past two days, and after he went through his pregame warmup on Sunday, the Warriors announced that he would play.
