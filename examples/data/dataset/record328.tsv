Thunder guard Russell Westbrook had a triple-double by halftime of Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Westbrook finished the half with 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists as the Thunder led 58-48 at the break. It was his league-leading 18th triple-double of the season, and the 37th of his career. He clinched it on an assist to Anthony Morrow for a 3-pointer with 11.9 seconds left in the second quarter.

According to STATS, which has kept track since the 2002-03 season, no player had a triple-double by halftime in a game until Westbrook's performance.

Kobe Bryant had 13 points at the break for the Lakers, all in the first quarter, in the final road game of his 20-year career.
