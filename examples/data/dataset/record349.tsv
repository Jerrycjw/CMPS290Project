Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel will start rookie forward Myles Turner on Saturday against Toronto.

Turner replaces veteran Lavoy Allen, who averaged 2.0 points and 4.3 rebounds during the first three games in the playoffs. The Raptors lead the best-of-seven series 2-1 after winning at Indiana on Thursday.

It's only the fifth time Toronto has had a lead in a series.

Turner played well off the bench in Games 1 and 3 and is averaging 11.7 points and 5.0 rebounds.

Vogel says he's making the change because Turner is producing and the Pacers have to "play the guys who are producing."

Center Ian Mahinmi also will start despite being listed as a questionable with a lower-back injury.
