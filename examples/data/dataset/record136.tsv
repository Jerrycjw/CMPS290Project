Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose is going to be back in action against the Washington Wizards after missing two games with a strained left groin.

Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said before Wednesday night's game that the team will "keep a close eye" on Rose and "monitor him at all the timeouts" to make sure he is OK.

Rose sat out a loss against Miami last Friday, and a win against Toronto on Monday.

Hoiberg also said Pau Gasol "most likely will not play" against visiting Brooklyn on Thursday. Hoiberg says "swelling has gone down significantly but he still has a little bit of pain in his knee."
