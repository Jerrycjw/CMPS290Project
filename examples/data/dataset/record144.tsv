A telethon to help Flint residents amid the Michigan city's crisis with lead-tainted water coupled with a match from Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores has raised more than $1.1 million.

The Flint native said he would match up to $1 million in donations made during Tuesday's telethon hosted by Detroit television station WDIV-TV. Organizers say the event drew more than 1,500 donations totaling $566,982. With Gores' match, that brings the total to $1,133,964.

The telethon, called "Flint Water Crisis: 4 Our Families ((hash)FlintKids)," benefits the Community Foundation of Greater Flint and its Flint Child Health and Development Fund.

If consumed, lead can cause developmental delays and learning disabilities. There are a number of efforts taking place to boost Flint education, health and support programs.

Gores earlier pledged to raise $10 million to help the city.
