The Indiana Pacers have put forward Chase Budinger on waivers.

The 6-foot-7 Budinger played in 49 games for Indiana, averaging 4.4 points and 2.5 rebounds after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last July.

The move Saturday could clear the way for the Pacers to add point guard Ty Lawson. Several media outlets reported earlier this week that Lawson has agreed to a deal with the Pacers, citing sources they did not identify. The team has not confirmed the deal and Lawson's agent did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Indiana plays at Washington on Saturday night.
