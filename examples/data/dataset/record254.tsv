NBA TV will feature a special free preview that will allow more fans to watch the historic matchup between the two teams with the league's best records, the Golden State Warriors (69-9) and the San Antonio Spurs (65-12), on Sunday, April 10 at 7 p.m. ET.

The network's free preview available this weekend will provide fans throughout the United States with the opportunity to watch not only the historic matchup but also all NBA TV coverage and programming leading up to the game. The free preview will be offered by leading cable, satellite and telco distributors.*

Earlier this year, the Warriors and Spurs Jan. 25 game on NBA TV was the most-watched and highest-rated NBA game in NBA TV history with 1,442,000 viewers.

The Warriors with 2014-15 Kia NBA MVP Stephen Curry and the Spurs with 15-time NBA All-Star Tim Duncan will meet at Golden State on TNT tonight, April 7 at 10:30 p.m. ET, before facing each other again at San Antonio on Sunday on NBA TV.

The Western Conference rivals, who have split their first two matchups this season, are both seeking to make NBA history. Golden State is bidding to set the NBA record for wins in a season, a mark held by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72-10). The Spurs, meanwhile, are 39-0 at home, putting them two wins from the first undefeated regular-season home record in league history.
