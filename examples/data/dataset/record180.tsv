Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry is not starting and not expected to play against the Celtics as he rests a sore right elbow.

The Raptors can clinch a playoff spot with a victory Wednesday or loss by either Chicago or Detroit

Lowry sustained the injury in Toronto's win over Orlando on Sunday. He played 40 minutes in that game, scoring 18 points.

Raptors coach Dwane Casey said before the game that he won't hesitate to rest players down the stretch to keep them fresh for the playoffs, even though Toronto is right behind Cleveland for the No. 1 seed in the East.
