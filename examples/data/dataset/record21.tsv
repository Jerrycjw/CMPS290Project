LeBron James didn't want to discuss his cryptic tweet, his quick trip to hang out with Dwyane Wade in Florida or much of anything.

It's good to be the king.

Following an unusual two-day break in their schedule, James and the Cavaliers returned to practice on Thursday to prepare for a stretch of three games in four nights. James met with reporters afterward, but the four-time league MVP wasn't in the mood to elaborate on his actions or whereabouts over the past few days.

On Tuesday, James posted a message on Twitter to his 28.5 million followers that seemed to be directed at one person.

"It's ok to know you've made a mistake," James wrote. "Cause we all do at times. Just be ready to live with whatever that comes with it and be with those who will protect you at all cost!"

The posting created speculation about its intended target, stirring up even more drama around the Cavaliers, but James refused to elaborate on his intentions.

James bluntly answered "No" when he was asked if he wanted to explain the tweet, which had some wondering if he was conspicuously calling out one of his teammates - something he has done on social media in the past.

"Nope," James said when asked if that was the case.

Of more concern to Clevelanders was James' visit to Miami, where he hung out with good friend and former teammate Wade, a potential playoff opponent this year. James went on the trip with his wife, Savannah, who has kept a business in Miami. And although James sold his mansion there last summer, he spent part of his offseason training in South Florida.

So why did he go there this time?

"Cause I want to," he said. "I would love to go to L.A., but I'll take 2 1/2 (hours of flight time to Miami) over 4 1/2 (flight to Los Angeles). "I've got a house in L.A. but it makes more sense for me to go south than go west. But I go because I want to."

The sight of he and Wade working out together is the last thing Cavs fans want to see, especially since James continues to sign one-year contracts with Cleveland and because he has left his home state before.

James was asked if he understands why some people might be upset he would meet with Wade.

"Yeah," he said. "I don't care."

James recently sat out Sunday's game at Washington and Cavs coach Tyronn Lue intends to sit him - and Cleveland's other starters - during some upcoming games so they're rested for the postseason and another run at an NBA title. The Cavs host the Wizards on Friday, Boston on Saturday and Memphis on Monday.

James said he and Lue have not yet discussed plans for time off.

"I'm going to go with what coach believes is the best for the team, believe is best for me," James said.

Lue, who took over when the Cavs fired David Blatt earlier this season, said he wants to have his rotation finalized with six or seven games left in the regular season.

"My whole thing is going into the playoffs you want to be on a good roll and playing good going into the playoffs, so, that's my thought, that's my philosophy," he said. "We'll still get guys rest when we have the chance to."

James concluded his nine-minute interview session by asking reporters if it was OK for him to leave.

He then said, "love you guys" before walking away.

Not long after, James went back on Twitter to post another mysterious message: "Can't replace being around great friends that reciprocate the same energy back to you in all facets of life."

If he's talking about Wade, he probably won't admit it.
