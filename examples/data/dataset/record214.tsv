The Sacramento Kings have signed general manager and vice president of basketball operations Vlade Divac to a new multiyear contract.

The team announced the move to keep Divac in the role running the franchise on Wednesday. Divac originally joined the front office last March, oversaw most of the offseason moves and was officially named to his current position in August.

Divac said he looks forward to building a winning team in Sacramento. The Kings (29-45) are headed to their 10th straight season without a playoff berth and face uncertainty this offseason about the status of coach George Karl.

The team moves into a new downtown arena next season and has a major building block in place in All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins.
