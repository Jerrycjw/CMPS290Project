Warriors coach Steve Kerr planned to speak with Draymond Green about a now-deleted video posted by the Golden State forward showing his speedometer at 118 mph.

Green said after Golden State's victory Wednesday night over the Clippers he used "poor judgment."

Kerr doesn't expect to have further issues with his emotional player, whose face isn't shown in the driver's seat of the speeding vehicle.

"He said he used poor judgment, which obviously is the case," Kerr said Thursday. "I'm very confident he won't do it again. I'm glad that he's fine and nobody got hurt or anything, but the main thing is he came out and apologized, so we move on."

Green is Golden State's third-leading scorer behind Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson at 13.7 points per game.

His video was shown on TMZ.com.

"Obviously, poor judgment," Green said Wednesday night. "But I'm not here to take any attention away from this team. But, like I said, poor judgment."

Green already apologized to his teammates, coaches and the organization for an emotional outburst late last month during halftime of the Warriors' 121-118 overtime victory at Oklahoma City.

"We hold all of our players and staff members to a high standard that sends a positive message and example to our fans and the community in general," the Warriors said.

The Warriors had a team picture Thursday but otherwise didn't hold a formal practice, though the players were at the facility working. Golden State (64-7) remains one game ahead of the 1995-96 Bulls' pace in their record 72-win season.

The defending champions take their 51-game home winning streak at Oracle Arena, including 33 consecutive victories this season, into Friday's game with Dallas.
