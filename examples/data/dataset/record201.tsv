Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose will miss tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons with an elbow injury.

Rose is sidelined with a bruised left elbow. He missed the second half of the Bulls' 103-100 victory over Houston on Thursday.

Rose said the elbow is getting better each day, but it remains tender. He was injured when he fell during the Bulls' 102-100 loss to Atlanta on Monday.

"Hurt, but I've just got to be smart," Rose said. "I'm out there playing with one hand."

Forward Taj Gibson is also not in the Bulls' starting lineup. Gibson is expected to miss his second consecutive game with a broken rib. He returned to the team Saturday after traveling to New York on Friday for a personal issue.

Bobby Portis is starting in place of Gibson. E'Twaun Moore is starting instead of Rose.
