Clippers coach Doc Rivers expects Blake Griffin to return before the regular season ends from a broken hand the star forward suffered by punching an assistant equipment manager.

Griffin isn't practicing yet with Los Angeles but he is running and shooting again, and "he's doing great. He looks pretty good, so that's why I feel confident," Rivers says.

Griffin was suspended for four games by Los Angeles and also docked five games' pay of $859,442 for the Jan. 23 altercation at a Toronto restaurant.

Rivers said before his team's game at Golden State, "I think he will (return) but I don't think any of us know anything in that regard. I think he will be."
