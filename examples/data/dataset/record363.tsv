Hawks guard Dennis Schroder did not practice Thursday because of an injured left ankle and remains questionable for Game 3 of the playoffs against the Boston Celtics.

Schroder was hurt in the closing minutes of Tuesday's 89-72 victory over the Celtics, which gave the Hawks a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

X-rays were negative, and Schroder accompanied the team as it left for Boston.

Coach Mike Budenholzer says Schroder is "making progress" and the team is "hopeful" he'll be able to play Friday night. If not, 35-year-old Kirk Hinrich will move into a backup role behind starting point guard Jeff Teague.

Hinrich was acquired at the trade deadline, mainly for this very scenario. He has played sparingly with the Hawks but Budenholzer says the veteran is "ready and capable."
