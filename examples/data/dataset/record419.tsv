Game 4 of the Warriors-Rockets series drew the largest television audience for the first round of the NBA playoffs in 14 years.

With MVP Stephen Curry returning from an ankle injury then spraining his knee late in the first half, Golden State's 121-94 victory Sunday averaged more than 7.2 million viewers on ABC.

ESPN said Tuesday that's the most since a Trail Blazers-Lakers game in 2002.
