â€” Toronto Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas will not play in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers because of an injured right ankle.

Coach Dwane Casey said Monday that Valanciunas is receiving treatment on the ankle he injured in Game 3 of the second-round against Miami. Casey didn't provide a timetable for the center's return but said "it's going to be very difficult" for Valanciunas to play Game 2.

Casey would not rule out the 7-footer for the entire series.

The loss of Valanciunas is a major blow to Toronto, making its first appearance in the East finals. He's averaging 15 points and 12 rebounds in 10 games during this postseason and shooting 55 percent from the field.

The Raptors managed to get past the Heat without the Valanciunas because of the strong play by backup Bismack Biyomobo.
