LeBron James has found a golfing partner to help local youth.

The NBA star's family foundation and the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational are teaming up to help educate students and enhance their interest in golf.

The tournament is pledging $50,000 from charity proceeds to fund various programs for students. They will have the opportunity to take outings to a TV affiliate to experience being an anchor, hit golf shots at a simulator of Firestone's signature "monster" 16th hole and get behind-the-scenes tours at the tournament site.

The Bridgestone Invitational is being held from June 27 to July 3.
