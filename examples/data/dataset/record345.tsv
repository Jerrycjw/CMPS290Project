Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas says he hasn't been suspended for taking a swing at Atlanta's Dennis Schroder during Game 3 of their first-round playoff series.

Thomas scored a career-high 42 points in Boston's 111-103 victory Friday night. He swung his arm at Schroder in the first quarter, hitting the Hawks point guard in the side of the head.

Thomas spent a restless night before getting the word from Celtics president Danny Ainge on Saturday afternoon that he wouldn't be suspended.

The Celtics will try to even the best-of-seven series at two games apiece in Game 4 on Sunday.
