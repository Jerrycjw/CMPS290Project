NBA Digital has added new statistics to the NBA app, including some that track player defensive performance.

The upgrades unveiled Wednesday include a tab for season totals in categories such as points, rebounds and assists, so users can switch between that and per-game averages.

New to the defensive impact page within the player tracking section is field goals made and field goal percentage while defending at the rim, and blocks per game in those situations.

The NBA app has 35 million downloads, with visits up 17 percent this season.
