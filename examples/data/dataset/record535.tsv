Less than 30 seconds remained in Florida's Southeastern Conference game at Alabama in late January 2015, and with the score tied at 50 then-Gator coach Billy Donovan knew he had a weapon at his disposal as he drew up a potential winning play.

Dorian Finney-Smith.

"Billy ran a play to get him in isolation," said Matt McCall, then a long-time Florida assistant, now the head coach at Chattanooga. "It was a double pick-and-roll, and we rolled the five man to the basket."

Simultaneous to that, Finney-Smith popped outside the 3-point line, and guard Chris Ciozza whipped a pass to him. Alabama's 6-foot-10 Jimmie Taylor sprinted to close out, but the 6-foot-8 Finney-Smith pump faked, split Taylor and another defender, and soared to the basket for a dunk.

That play gave Florida a scant two-point lead, which Finney-Smith then preserved by racing to the other end of the floor to block Levi Randolph's layup attempt.

After the game, a proud Donovan recounted the play. "I like that [Finney-Smith] took the ball to the rim, and he made a great play," he said. "I didn't see [his view was blocked by an official] Alabama's defense or the way they were rotating or trying to come over from, but it looked like a pretty clear path."

It was a pretty clear path.

"The action they ran, we were supposed to guard it a specific way," said then-Alabama coach Anthony Grant. "And we didn't. Dorian Finney-Smith made a heck of a play. They got into the late clock, and he attacked the rim."

If Finney-Smith's long-time dream comes true in June, and he hears his name called on NBA Draft day, he could be making plays like that for a living, as early as next season. After Donovan left for the Oklahoma City Thunder, he was replaced by Mike White, who coached Finney-Smith for only a season but has no doubt about his NBA readiness.

"His ceiling compared to some of these guys people are weighing against, him in terms of drafting him or Dorian, might not measure up," White said. "We're talking about 6-9 freak [athletes] with vertical leaps. But I think [Finney-Smith] is a guy that right now is ready. He played in the Final Four. He can contribute to a winner, get out there and not hurt you, guard a couple of positions.

"There's a need, I think, for a guy who's got a high IQ, who's very versatile. He's going to be accepting of a role. He's multi-positional. I think he can play some three, and teams can play some small ball with him at the four. He can pass, dribble and shoot it. There's a lot to like."

It would be fair to say that Finney-Smith is uniquely qualified for the difficult task of making an NBA roster. He's endured unspeakable tragedy, having witnessed the shooting death of his brother at a party in his hometown of Portsmouth, Va. At 18, he fathered a daughter. And during his college career, he played for three coaches.

The first was ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg, who, then the coach at Virginia Tech, recruited Finney-Smith out of high school, was well aware of the burdens the player carried and became a trusted mentor.

"I got close to him," Finney-Smith said of Greenberg. "I still stay in contact with him. When he got fired, that opened my eyes. For a kid just coming from high school, I didn't know, but [college basketball] is a business."

After Greenberg's departure, Finney-Smith made his own business decision. He'd been heavily recruited out of high school by Florida, so he transferred to play for Donovan. Under the future Hall of Fame coach, Finney-Smith's game blossomed. He led the Gators in rebounding in his first two years and showed promised as a future NBA three and defensive stopper, capable of stretching defenses with deep shooting range and guarding multiple positions with his length, intelligence and, perhaps most important, his willingness.

After the 2014-15 season, having demonstrated by that dunk at Alabama and numerous other plays that he had NBA potential, Finney-Smith had another decision to make. Hoping to learn one more season from Donovan, he chose not to declare for the Draft. And then Donovan, who had flirted for years with the NBA, even taking the Orlando Magic job for about a day and a half in 2007, left for the Thunder.

By that time, having missed the deadline to declare, Finney-Smith had no choice but to stay at Florida.

"It was tough," Finney-Smith said. "But after coach Donovan left, he talked to me like a man. He told me I can still have a good year, still accomplish my goals."

Fortunately for Finney-Smith, Florida hired a coach in Mike White who played a fast-paced system, just like Donovan did. And there was one other side benefit for Finney-Smith. White played at Ole Miss, where, just before his senior season, coach Rob Evans left for Arizona State and was replaced by assistant Rod Barnes.

"So I knew where Dorian was coming from," White said. "It's tough not to finish out your career for the coach you'd signed with and gotten to know and trust. After coach Donovan left, it was tough on Dorian, but he handled it with maturity. He was down for a while, but he made the best of the hand he was dealt."

Finney-Smith wound up leading Florida in scoring, and for the third consecutive season, rebounding, while earning second-team All-Southeastern Conference honors. Clearly, he had evolved too much since the death of his brother, and four years (counting a redshirt season at Florida) in college, to let Donovan's departure derail his dreams.

By all accounts from people who know him well, time, and the college experience, changed Finney-Smith for the better, as a player and a person. When he first showed up at Virginia Tech, he was withdrawn, having retreated inward because of his brother's death.

"That was hard for me, being 15, 16 years old and seeing your brother get shot," Finney-Smith said. "I thought I had to be strong for my mom, and my whole family. But I never had time to grieve."

Greenberg was aware of what happened, but he knew Finney-Smith would only unload his burden if and when he felt the need. Greenberg gave Finney-Smith his personal space, but didn't let up as a coach.

"I didn't always tell him what he wanted to hear," Greenberg said. "I told him the truth. College basketball was a little more difficult than he thought it was going to be. I helped him navigate through that. I had no doubt he was going to be a terrific player."

Finney-Smith bonded with and trusted Greenberg, and when Virginia Tech made a coaching change, Finney-Smith knew he had to move on as well. His decision to play for Donovan paid dividends on the court, but the Florida experience was just as important off it. One day in 2014, the year the Gators played in the Final Four, Finney-Smith spoke about his brother's death for the first time, during a team meeting. Though Greenberg had explained the situation to Donovan, Finney-Smith's teammates didn't know.

"I just broke down," Finney-Smith said. "It was the first time I'd ever talked about it. I think it brought our team closer together."

Finney-Smith was a changed man after that. He'd always been a favorite of his coaches and teammates, but he was more at ease, and more focused.

"He's an incredible human being," McCall said. "A joy to be around. He'll brighten your day. He has an unbelievable impact on people. His work ethic over the years really got better, too. Coach Donovan was on his [butt] about his motor and playing hard all the time, practicing hard, stuff like that. That was all really important to Billy. And it got better as time went on."

So much so that Finney-Smith thinks he's ready for the NBA. He's not alone.

"There's not a whole lot that can be thrown at him right now that he's not mature enough to handle," Greenberg said. "I have no doubt there's a place for him on an NBA roster. He has skill. He has feel. Unbelievable IQ. The ball finds him.

"The NBA is a league without positions. And that's who he is."

Finney-Smith boosted his draft stock last month with a strong showing at the Portsmouth Invitational, where he was able to play in front of family and friends. One of those interested spectators was his daughter, now five.

"We're tight," Finney-Smith said. "And she's old enough now, she knows what the NBA is. The other day she asked me, 'Daddy, are you playing in the NBA yet?' And I said no, I just graduated from Florida.' "
