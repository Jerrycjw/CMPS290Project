The Utah Jazz have announced that forward Gordon Hayward will not play Monday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers due to plantar fasciitis in his right foot.

Hayward's status is officially day-to-day.

Hayward leads the team with averages of 20.1 points, 3.7 assists and 36.2 minutes per game. He also averages 4.9 rebounds per game.

The Jazz have been decimated by injuries this season with Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors both missing long stretches. Alec Burks is still recovering from a broken fibula and Dante Exum missed the entire season with a torn ACL.

The Jazz (31-35) are currently two games behind the Dallas Mavericks in the race for the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference.
