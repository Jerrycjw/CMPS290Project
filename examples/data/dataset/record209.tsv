Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins has received a one-game suspension without pay for receiving his 16th technical foul of the 2015-16 season, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Under NBA rules, a player or coach is automatically suspended without pay for one game once he receives his 16th technical foul during a regular season. For every two additional technical fouls received during that regular season, the player or coach will be automatically suspended for an additional game.

Cousins received his most recent technical foul with 0:06 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Kings' 120-111 win over the Washington Wizards on March 30 at Sleep Train Arena. Cousins will serve his suspension on Friday, April 1 when Sacramento hosts the Miami Heat.
