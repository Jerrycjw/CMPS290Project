Rookie center Jahlil Okafor is day to day after missing Philadelphia's 116-108 loss at Washington with a bruised right shin.

Okafor got hurt during his 26-point performance in Sunday's loss at Orlando. The No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft is averaging 17.5 points and 7.0 rebounds.

Coach Brett Brown thinks the 20-year-old Okafor will only have to miss one game.
