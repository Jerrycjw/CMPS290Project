The New Orleans Pelicans say guard Eric Gordon has undergone surgery to repair his fractured right ring finger and will miss the remainder of the season.

Gordon's injury occurred on Saturday night against Utah, the second time this season he injured the same finger. A similar injury sidelined him 16 games. When the 6-foot-4 Gordon finally returned a little more than a week ago, he averaged nearly 23 points during three full games before re-injuring his finger in the first half of Saturday night's loss.

The 27-year-old Gordon, who is in the final season of his contract, has played in 45 games this season, averaging 15.2 points, 2.7 assists, 2.2 rebounds and a steal in 32.9 minutes per game.
