The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Bryce Cotton to a 10-day contract under the NBA's hardship roster rules.

The Grizzlies announced the deal Friday.

Memphis already has had 27 different players take the court this season, and Cotton playing will help the Grizzlies set the NBA record for most players to log minutes in a single season. The Grizzlies currently are tied with the 1996-97 Dallas Mavericks for the single-season record.

The 6-foot-1, 165 pound Cotton has played in 18 games with the Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns averaging 4.7 points and 1.0 assists in 10.7 minutes per game since going undrafted in 2014 after four seasons at Providence.

The Grizzlies, losers of four straight, host Toronto on Friday night holding the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference.
