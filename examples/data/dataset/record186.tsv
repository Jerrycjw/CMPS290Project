NBA Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo was at the Brussels airport during a deadly terrorist attack early Tuesday.

Mutombo posted two messages on his Facebook page to let everyone know he was not injured. The Atlanta Hawks confirmed that he was in Belgium when the terrorists struck at both the airport and on a subway, killing at least 31 people and wounding scores.

Mutombo posted one photo showing people walking around outside the airport, accompanied by the message, "God is good. I am in Brussels Airport with this craziness. I am fine." He followed with a selfie and another message, "Thank you everyone. I am safe here. God is good."

The 49-year-old Mutombo is a native of the Congo who now lives in Atlanta. The eight-time All-Star retired in 2009.
