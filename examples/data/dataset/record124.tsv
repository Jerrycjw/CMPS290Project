The window is open -- if only a crack.

With the king of the mountain hobbled, this may be the last (and only) chance for someone to catch him. Is anyone ready to stand up and make a major move? In all honesty, only two guys have a realistic shot at ascending to the top.

A shooting guard's latest cold spell has opened the door for a handful of names. Meanwhile, one player in particular continues to step up for the injury-riddled Grizzlies while a future Hall of Famer falls off the list for the first time since Week 11.

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 17. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 1 game, 17.0 ppg, 12.0 rpg, 9.0 apg

Season stats: 17.0 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 4.1 apg

The big fella only played one game last week because of knee inflammation, but what a stat-stuffer it was: 17 points (7-for-12 shooting, including 2-for-3 3-pointers), 12 rebounds, nine assists and two blocks. With Gasol already listed out for Saturday's game, this is a big opportunity for someone to shake up the OSPR.

2. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 3 games, 24.3 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.7 apg

Ever since we bumped him to No. 5 in Week 15, Nowitzki has played like a man on a mission, averaging 23.1 points on 51.5 FG% in his last eight games. In fact, he now has six straight games of 20 or more points after surpassing the mark just twice in the previous 10 games. Here's your shot at the top of the mountain, Dirk.

3. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 3 games, 13.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 19.0 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.7 apg

This was one of Wade's ugliest weeks in a while (a lingering thigh injury certainly played a role), as he shot just 30.2 from the field and eclipsed 12 points in one of three games. Last Friday's nine-point effort was the first time he didn't register double-figuring scoring since going for eight on Feb. 14, a span of 11 games.

4. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 4 games, 18.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.0 apg

Season stats: 12.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.9 apg

With his teammate off, Johnson picked up the slack, going for 13 or more points in all four games on 52.9 FG%, 52.6 3PT% and 83.3 FT%. Johnson has now gone four straight games with two or more 3-pointers and seven consecutive of 50 percent or better from the field. It certainly looks like Johnson has found his stroke.

Johnson Hits 28 Joe Johnson drops 28 points on 11-21 shooting with five assists and four rebounds versus Toronto.

5. Matt Barnes (36), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 5 games, 16.0 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 3.6 apg

Season stats: 9.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

The good: four games with 14 or more points. The bad: 33.7 shooting from the field. The impressive: a career-first triple-double last Friday (26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists). Also falling under the good category is the fact Barnes has made two or more 3-pointers in seven of his last eight games.

Nightly Notable: Matt Barnes Matt Barnes scores 26 points with 11 rebounds and 10 assists to record the first triple-double of his career.

6. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: 8

Last week's stats: 3 games, 10.0 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 6.4 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

Aside from Thursday's four-point, two-rebound performance against the Jazz, Chandler has been balling -- to the tune of nine or more rebounds in seven of his last eight. He's also managed four double-doubles in the last seven and is shooting 64.8 from the field in the last nine.

7. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.5 ppg, 1.0 rpg, 3.0 apg

Season stats: 13.7 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.2 apg

Is it getting drafty in here or what? It doesn't get much more frigid than Crawford's shooting last week (12-for-42 for 28.6 percent from the field). In fact, since being elevated to No. 3 on our list in Week 15, Crawford has hit a rough patch, shooting 50 percent or better from the field in just once in the previous eight games.

8. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 8.0 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 8.3 apg

Season stats: 12.2 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.4 apg

If not for Thursday's impressive 18-point, 16-assist showing against the Trail Blazers, Parker would've fallen off the list. That's because the rest of the week was Ugly (yes, with a capital 'U'). In his two other games, Parker averaged 3.0 points, 4.5 assists and 11 percent (1-for-9 shooting) from the field.

9. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: Didn't play

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 apg

What have you done for me lately? If you're Z-Bo, nothing. Randolph has missed the last seven games with soreness in his right knee. Before the injury, he managed 15 or more points in five of his last six games. If he misses all of next week's games, Randolph will be off the list for the first time since Week 2.

10. Nene (33), Washington Wizards

Last week's rank: NA

Last week's stats: 5 games, 10.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.6 apg

Season stats: 8.7 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.6 apg

Despite getting just 19.5 minutes last week, Nene was productive enough to climb onto the list. In addition to shooting 57.6 from the field, Nene chipped in 1.6 steals (including four in Monday's win over the Pistons). The big man has now scored in double figures in five of his last seven after going eight consecutive games under 10 points.

Just missed the cut: Tony Allen, Kyle Korver, Jason Terry, Kobe Bryant
