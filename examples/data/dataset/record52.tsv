Ralph Lawler is going Hollywood.

The veteran Los Angeles Clippers broadcaster is getting his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Lawler's star in the radio category will be dedicated on Thursday during a ceremony attended by Clippers coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers. The star will be located on Vine Street near a sports bar.

The 77-year-old broadcaster is in his 37th year handling play-by-play for the Clippers, making him the third-longest tenured broadcaster in the NBA. Lawler has broadcast more than 2,800 Clippers games during his career.

He will have the 2,575th star on the Walk of Fame.
