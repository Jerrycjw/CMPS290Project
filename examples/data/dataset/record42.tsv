The Toronto Raptors announced Tuesday they have signed NBA veteran power forward Jason Thompson. Per team policy, financial details were not disclosed.

Thompson, 6-foot-11, 250 pounds, is in his eighth season. He has appeared in 569 career regular season games, averaging 9.0 points, 6.7 rebounds and 25.5 minutes.

"We are pleased to add a player like Jason who has logged quality minutes in more than 500 career games," said Raptors President and General Manager Masai Ujiri.

A first-round selection (12th overall) by Sacramento in 2008, Thompson spent seven seasons with the Kings before joining Golden State this season. His best statistical campaign came in 2009-10 when he averaged 12.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 31.4 minutes.

To make room on the roster the Raptors released forward Anthony Bennett. Bennett appeared in 19 games, totaling 28 points, 23 rebounds and 84 minutes.

"We thank Anthony for his professionalism and for his service to our team and community," said Ujiri. "We know he's on his way to becoming an excellent NBA player but as we approach the end of the season Jason will provide us with a veteran presence that we need."

The Raptors return to action Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. versus Utah at Air Canada Centre (TSN/Sportsnet 590 The FAN).
