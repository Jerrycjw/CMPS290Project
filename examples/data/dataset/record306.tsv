Ernie Grunfeld is sticking around as president of the Washington Wizards, saying at a news conference that he would be "heading up the coaching search" to replace the fired Randy Wittman.

Grunfeld, with the Wizards since 2003, met with the media on Thursday, a day after Wittman was told he wouldn't be returning as coach and the regular season ended with Washington at .500 and out of the playoffs.

Grunfeld lamented a lack of consistency under Wittman this season, after having reached the second round of the playoffs the previous two years.

Says Grunfeld: "We all feel like we missed an opportunity."

Grunfeld says "a lot of candidates" will want what he described as a "desirable" coaching job and some have "already shown their interest."
