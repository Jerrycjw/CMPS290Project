The Warriors' game in San Antonio on Sunday on NBA TV will be available for free to fans who don't normally get the channel.

NBA Digital announced Thursday that the key matchup in Golden State's pursuit of a record 73 wins will be available as part of a free preview of the network to cable and satellite subscribers.

The Warriors have 69 victories with four games to play, and Sunday could be the biggest roadblock, though the Spurs might rest some of their stars. ESPN has also added a national broadcast of Saturday's game at Memphis.

Golden State hosts San Antonio on Thursday night then faces the Grizzlies at home Wednesday to close the regular season. The Warriors are looking to break the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' record of 72 wins.
