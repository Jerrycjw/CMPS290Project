Charlotte Hornets forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Game 4 against Miami, while Heat center Hassan White's status will be a game-time decision in their first round series Monday night.

Miami leads the series 2-1.

Hornets coach Steve Clifford said Monday Batum was unable to participate in shootaround and will miss his second straight game with a strained foot. The Hornets beat the Heat 96-80 in Game 3 despite Batum's absence.

Whiteside got hit in the thigh on a pick and roll in the fourth quarter of Saturday night's game and hasn't practiced since.

Whiteside said he will see how the thigh feels before the game prior to making a decision on whether or not to play.
