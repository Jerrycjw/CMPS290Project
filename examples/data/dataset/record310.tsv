The Washington Wizards announced today that they will not pick up the option on the contract of Head Coach Randy Wittman.

"There were high internal and external expectations for this team coming into this season based on the momentum we had generated over the previous two years," said Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld. "Unfortunately, the inconsistency of the team's performance and effort, particularly on our home court, did not allow us to meet those expectations and we decided a coaching change was needed."

Wittman was originally promoted to head coach on January 24, 2012, and compiled a 178-199 (.472) overall record in four-and-a-half seasons with the Wizards. During his tenure, the team advanced to the second round of the playoffs twice (2014 and 2015).

"Randy should be commended for the job he did in taking over as head coach during a very difficult time for our franchise and for helping to establish a culture and identity that led to success," said Grunfeld. "This was a very tough decision on a personal level, and we wish Randy and his family the best moving forward."
