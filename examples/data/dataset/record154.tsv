The Los Angeles Clippers say Blake Griffin has been medically cleared to return to the team and will immediately begin serving a four-game suspension for punching their assistant equipment manager.

Griffin, who has not played since December, practiced with the Clippers on Saturday. He was cleared by the team's doctor before Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets.

He will sit out that game, along with games against Boston, Minnesota and Oklahoma City for punching Matias Testi in January.

Griffin's absence has been the result of a partially torn tendon in his left quad and a broken hand requiring surgery that he suffered in the incident with Testi in Toronto.

Griffin becomes eligible to play again on April 3 against Washington.

He is averaging 23.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists in 30 games this season.
