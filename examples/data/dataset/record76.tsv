Kevin Love has been scratched from the Cleveland Cavaliers' lineup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night because of discomfort and swelling in his knees.

The eight-year veteran and three-time All-Star, whose four-point play with 1:32 remaining helped beat the Sacramento Kings 120-111 the night before, sat out for the third time in his second season with the Cavaliers. Love is averaging 15.8 points and 10.0 rebounds.

Channing Frye started in place of Love.

Love had 17 points and 10 rebounds in Sacramento on Wednesday.
