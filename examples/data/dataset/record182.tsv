Carmelo Anthony returned to the New York Knicks' starting lineup Wednesday night against the Chicago Bulls after missing a loss Sunday night against Sacramento because of a migraine headache.

The star forward started feeling symptoms in a loss to Washington on Saturday. He is averaging 21.8 points and 8.0 rebounds this season.

The Knicks are 0-8 without Anthony this season.
