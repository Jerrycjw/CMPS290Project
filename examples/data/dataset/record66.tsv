The Memphis Grizzlies today announced injury updates for guard Mike Conley and center Chris Andersen.

Conley has missed the last two games with left foot soreness and received an additional examination Friday, which showed Achilles tendonitis. He will remain out and will be re-evaluated in 3 to 4 weeks.

Conley has appeared in 56 games (all starts) this season for the Grizzlies and averaged 15.3 points, 2.9 rebounds, a team-high 6.1 assists and 1.20 steals in 31.4 minutes.

Andersen experienced a left shoulder subluxation and left the game on March 6 vs. Phoenix with 7:59 remaining in the second quarter. Additional examination and an MRI confirmed the injury. He will be listed as out and will continue to be re-evaluated.

Andersen has appeared in nine games (four starts) this season for the Grizzlies and recorded 4.0 points and 4.7 rebounds in 16.9 minutes. He was acquired by Memphis from Miami in a three-team trade (also involving Charlotte) on Feb. 16.
