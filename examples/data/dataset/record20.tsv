The New Orleans Pelicans say 7-foot-2 center Alexis Ajinca will be sidelined indefinitely because of a fractured sternum.

The Pelicans say the diagnosis came after Ajinca had an MRI before Thursday night's home game against the San Antonio Spurs.

Ajinca was injured during the fourth quarter of Wednesday night's loss at Houston.

A French national now in his sixth year in the NBA, Ajinca has played in 47 games this season with nine starts, averaging 4.4 points and 4.0 rebounds.

Ajinca's injury comes with 7-foot center Omer Asik, a starter, out with a right ankle sprain.

The Pelicans also have lost forward Quincy Pondexter (left knee), guard Tyreke Evans (right knee) and guard Bryce Dejean-Jones (right wrist) for the season.
