â€” Kobe Bryant's farewell poem to basketball is getting the short film treatment with some high profile talent behind it.

Entitled "Dear Basketball," the animated short film will be scored by acclaimed composer John Williams and directed by longtime Disney animator Glen Keane, best known for his work on "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin." Bryant will narrate.

The retired L.A. Lakers great announced the project on Thursday, a co-production between Sports Illustrated, Believe Entertainment Group, and Bryant's new production studio Kobe Studios. The poem served as Bryant's retirement announcement last year.

Bryant says the film is "the perfect tribute to something I've loved so long."

The short film and a behind the scenes look at the making of the film will premiere on SI.com
