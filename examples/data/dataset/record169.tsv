Manu Ginobili will be available to play for Argentina's basketball team in the Rio Olympics.

The Argentine federation announced Ginobili's decision Thursday. It will be a fourth Olympics for the San Antonio Spurs star, who has led Argentina to a gold and bronze medal in three appearances.

Argentina won gold in 2004 and bronze four years later in Beijing, but lost to Russia in the third-place game in 2012. His Olympic career appeared over, but the Argentines somewhat surprisingly earned a berth in Rio last summer by reaching the final of the FIBA Americas tournament.

Ginobili didn't play on that team, but will rejoin longtime teammate Luis Scola as the Argentines play in a difficult Group B that includes Spain, Lithuania, Brazil and Nigeria.
