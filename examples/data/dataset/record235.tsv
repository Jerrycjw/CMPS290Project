San Antonio star Tim Duncan was held out for the Spurs' game against Golden State on Sunday night.

Duncan, who turns 40 on April 25, rested after playing back-to-back games. He had four points in 19 minutes in a 112-101 loss to the Warriors on Thursday and 21 points in 35 minutes in Friday's 102-98 loss at Denver.

The Spurs were trying to stay undefeated at home. The Warriors were looking to match the NBA record for most victories in a season.

Golden State had lost 33 in a row in San Antonio dating to February 1997.

San Antonio also was without Boris Diaw, who has a sore muscle on his right side. Coach Gregg Popovich said David West would start with Diaw and Duncan out.

The Warriors rested Leandro Barbosa, but coach Steve Kerr said the rest of the roster is available.

Golden State was seeking its 72nd victory, which would tie the record set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96.
