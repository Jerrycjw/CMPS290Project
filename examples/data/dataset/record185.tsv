Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry says forward Ryan Anderson, who has been New Orleans' second-leading scorer this season, has been ruled out of playing in Tuesday night's game against the Miami Heat because of groin strains in both legs.

Known for his ability to spread defenses with his 3-point shooting, the 6-foot-10 Anderson has averaged 17 points per game this season. Only forward Anthony Davis, who is out the rest of the season, has averaged more points for the Pelicans.

This marks the second straight game Anderson is missing, having also sat out last Sunday's victory over the Los Angeles Clippers

Gentry says team doctors are still trying to determine if it makes more sense to simply sit Anderson out for the final 13 games of the regular season.
