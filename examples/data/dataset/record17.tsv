Stephen Curry is set to return to the starting lineup for the Golden State Warriors after missing a game with a sprained left ankle.

The Warriors announced Curry was active for Thursday night's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Golden State also says forward Andre Iguodala will play after missing the previous game with a tight left hamstring.

Curry hurt the ankle Saturday in Oklahoma City but returned to that game and tied an NBA record with 12 3-pointers, including the game-winner from 37 feet in overtime. Curry sat out Tuesday night's game against Atlanta but practiced the past two days and took his usual pregame warmups before being declared active.

Golden State is looking to tie Chicago's NBA record with a 44th straight regular-season home win.
