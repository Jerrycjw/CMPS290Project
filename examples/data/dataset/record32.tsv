Carmelo Anthony is apologizing for his interaction with a fan during the New York Knicks' latest loss.

The All-Star forward said Wednesday in a statement that he was frustrated but shouldn't have responded the way he did.

Anthony said after Tuesday's 104-85 home loss to Portland that the fan was yelling at him, vowing to never come to another Knicks game. Anthony pointed to Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan and told the fan: "Look, the owner's right there. Ask for your money back."

The Knicks have lost 15 of their last 18 games.

Anthony says: "We are all frustrated by the team's recent results - everyone, including me, my teammates, coaches and the fans. Last night, a fan and I let those frustrations get the best of us. I should not have responded the way I did."
