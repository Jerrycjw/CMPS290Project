Hawks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. is active for Game 1 of Atlanta's playoff series against the Boston Celtics.

Hardaway strained his right groin in the Hawks' regular-season finale against Washington. He was listed as questionable for the opener of the best-of-seven series, but felt good enough in pregame warmups to suit up.

Hardaway endured a rocky first season in Atlanta, playing only four of the first 35 games and even doing several stints in the D-League. But he's played a much bigger role down the stretch, giving the team another outside scoring threat off the bench and someone who can speed up the transition game.

Over the final 14 games, Hardaway averaged 10.2 points and hit nearly 41 percent of his 3-pointers.
