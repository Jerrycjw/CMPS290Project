Tim Hardaway Jr. is making his first start of the season for the Atlanta Hawks as Kent Bazemore is held out with a bone bruise in his right knee.

Coach Mike Budenholzer said before Thursday night's game against the Denver Nuggets he hopes Bazemore's injury is "pretty short term."

Budenholzer says Bazemore suffered the injury in a fall late in Wednesday night's win at Detroit. Budenholzer says he prefers to keep Thabo Sefolosha as a substitute who can bring defensive punch off the bench.

Hardaway, acquired from the Knicks in June, has averaged only 4.9 points in 37 games. He was mostly invisible on Atlanta's roster until January, when his playing time became more significant and consistent.
