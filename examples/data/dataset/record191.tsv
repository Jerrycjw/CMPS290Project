Chicago Bulls center Pau Gasol will return against the Sacramento Kings on Monday night after missing the previous four games with right knee swelling.

Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg says Gasol is "chomping at the bit to get back on the floor. Obviously, we flow better with him out there."

Gasol, who is averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds, hasn't played since March 11 against Miami. After resting for about a week, he tested the knee in workouts on Saturday and Sunday.

Hoiberg says the plan was "to control his minutes and see how he responds to it. He's handled two straight days of activity very well."
