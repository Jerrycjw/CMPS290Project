Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside will start Game 4 against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night despite missing the last two practices with a bruised right thigh.

Whiteside's status had been listed as a game-time decision.

Says Miami coach Erick Spoelstra, "Hopefully the adrenaline will kick in and he'll get through it."

Whiteside got hit in the thigh on a pick and roll in the fourth quarter of Saturday night's game.

Charlotte small forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Game 4 with a strained foot. Batum also missed Game 3, which the Hornets won 96-80 at home. Frank Kaminsky will start in his place.

Coach Steve Clifford is unsure if Batum will be ready for Game 5 in Miami on Wednesday night, saying the ankle is "very weak."

Miami leads the series 2-1.
