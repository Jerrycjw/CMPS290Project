Grizzlies guard Mike Conley has Achilles tendinitis in his left foot that will keep him out for at least 3 to 4 weeks, after which he will be re-evaluated.

The Grizzlies provided an update on Conley's injury on Saturday, along with that of center Chris Andersen, who remains out after dislocating his left shoulder March 6 in a loss to Phoenix. The Grizzlies say Andersen will continue to be re-evaluated.

Conley has missed the last three games with soreness in his foot. He started all 56 games he has played this season, averaging 15.3 points and a team-high 6.1 assists.

This is just the latest wave of injuries for the Grizzlies (39-26), who remain fifth in the Western Conference despite a changing lineup. Memphis plays at Atlanta on Saturday night, a night after beating New Orleans in overtime with a rookie point guard signed out of the D-League on a 10-day contract earlier in the day.

Briante Weber was signed after Memphis waived guard Mario Chalmers, who ruptured his right Achilles tendon in a loss at Boston on Wednesday night. Weber scored 10 points and had seven assists in 40 minutes against New Orleans.

The Grizzlies looked for more short-term help on Saturday by signing guard Ray McCallum and center Alex Stepheson to 10-day contracts. The two were active for Saturday night's game in Atlanta.

McCallum played in 31 games, including three starts, for San Antonio this season before being waived on Feb. 29.

The Grizzlies already are without center Marc Gasol, who had season-ending surgery to repair a broken navicular bone in his right foot last month. Zach Randolph has missed three straight games with a sore right knee. Jordan Adams has been out since having surgery on his right knee, and Brandan Wright also is recovering from a sore right knee.
