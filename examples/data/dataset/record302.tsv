The Seattle Storm selected 6-foot-4 forward Breanna Stewart from the University of Connecticut with the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft Thursday night.

UConn's star averaged 19.4 points and 8.7 rebounds to lead the Huskies to a fourth consecutive national championship. She became the first player in NCAA history to earn most outstanding player of the Final Four all four years. Stewart is the fifth Huskies player to be taken first in the draft.

It marked the second straight season that the Storm had the top pick in the draft. Seattle took Jewell Loyd first last year. The team also had back-to-back No. 1 selections in 2001 and 2002 when Seattle drafted Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird.

Fellow UConn players Moriah Jefferson was selected by the San Antonio Stars with the No. 2 pick. Morgan Tuck was selected third by the Connecticut Sun.
