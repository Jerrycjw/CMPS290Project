â€” Los Angeles guard Austin Rivers left the Clippers' first-round playoff game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night with a bloody cut above his left eye.

Rivers was injured in a collision with Portland's Al-Farouq Aminu midway through the first quarter. He was escorted to the locker room by trainers, but later returned to the game in the second quarter after receiving stitches.

Rivers started Game 6 in the absence of Chris Paul, who broke a bone in his right hand earlier in the series. The Clippers were also without Blake Griffin, who was ruled out for the remainder the series after re-injuring his left quad.

Rivers, the son of Clippers coach Doc Rivers, has averaged 8.2 points per game in the series.
