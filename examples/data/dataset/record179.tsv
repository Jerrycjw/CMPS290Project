Detroit guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is sitting out the Pistons' game Wednesday against Orlando because of an illness.

Backup guard Reggie Bullock is also out with an illness. The Pistons started rookie Darrun Hilliard, a second-round draft pick.

Caldwell-Pope is averaging 14.7 points and a team-high 36.8 minutes. The Pistons are playing the fifth game of a nine-game homestand that could go a long way toward determining whether they make the playoffs for the first time since 2009.

Orlando is without center Nikola Vucevic, who has been out with a strained right groin.
