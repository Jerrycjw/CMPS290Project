Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal left a game Saturday night against the Indiana Pacers midway through the third quarter with a sprained pelvis and is doubtful to return.

Beal scored 12 points before taking a nasty fall on a layup attempt with 6:17 remaining in the period.

After taking Ian Mahinmi's foul, Beal continued driving. He lost his balance during Myles Turner's block attempt and crashed hard to the ground on his right hip. He had to be helped off the court.

Beal missed 16 games in December and January with a right leg stress reaction. He entered Saturday averaging 18.0 points in 40 games.
