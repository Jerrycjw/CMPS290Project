Mavericks forward Chandler Parsons is having surgery on his right knee again but might not be finished for the season.

A person with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday that Parsons was having arthroscopic surgery for a meniscus tear in his right knee but could return.

The team said Parsons will not make the upcoming four-game road trip because of the right knee injury, and coach Rick Carlisle declined to discuss the specifics. The person spoke of Parsons' injury on the condition of anonymity because details weren't released.

Parsons left in the third quarter of Friday's loss to Golden State with what the team said was right hamstring soreness. He missed Sunday's win over Portland.

The Mavericks play the Trail Blazers again Wednesday night before going to Golden State, Sacramento and Denver.

The injury isn't considered as serious as the one that knocked Parsons out of the first round of the playoffs last season and required surgery and a long rehabilitation that carried over into training camp and limited his playing time early this season.

Parsons could resume basketball activities within six weeks, which means he could be available when the playoffs start in mid-April. There are roughly three weeks left in the regular season.

The timing of the injury isn't good for the Mavericks, who lose a starter while in a four-way battle for the final three playoff spots in the Western Conference. Dallas (35-35) is tied for seventh with Houston but can overtake Portland for sixth with a win at the Blazers. Utah (34-36) is also in the mix.

The previous knee injury came late last regular season, and Parsons tried to return for the playoffs. He played the opener against Houston but sat the rest of that five-game loss to Houston, his former team.

The 27-year-old Parsons came back from surgery sooner than expected, missing only the first two games before playing on a minutes restriction while skipping the second night of most back-to-backs.

By December, he was playing close to 30 minutes and occasionally in back-to-back games. One of his best games came in January, when he had 25 points and eight rebounds in 41 minutes in a 110-107 overtime loss to Cleveland and LeBron James.

Parsons is averaging 13.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 30 minutes over 61 games, including 51 starts.
