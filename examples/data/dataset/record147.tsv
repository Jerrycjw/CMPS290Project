Chris Bosh returned to the Miami Heat bench on Monday night, his first appearance since being sidelined by a blood clot last month.

Bosh was dressed in a gray sport coat and took a seat toward the end of the bench for a game against the Denver Nuggets. It was Bosh's first time being seen at AmericanAirlines Arena since Feb. 9, Miami's last home game before the All-Star break.

Bosh withdrew from the All-Star festivities in Toronto because of what was called a calf strain. It was later learned that he had a clot, the same problem that ended his season early a year ago.

Bosh released a statement last week saying he no longer has a clot in his leg. It's unknown if he can play again this season.
