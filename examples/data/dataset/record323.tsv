Udonis Haslem will miss Miami's regular-season finale at Boston on Wednesday night with soreness in his left foot.

Haslem was hurt in the fourth quarter of Miami's win at Detroit on Tuesday, limping immediately to the locker room after leaving the game and not returning.

He has appeared in 37 games for the Heat this season, averaging 1.6 points.

Haslem played in each of Miami's last six games going into Wednesday, his longest streak of appearances since December. He and Dwyane Wade are the only two players to be on all three of Miami's NBA championship teams, both of them now completing their 13th season with the Heat.

Miami opens the playoffs this weekend. It's unclear if Haslem will be available.
