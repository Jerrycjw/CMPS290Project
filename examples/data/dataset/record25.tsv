Carmelo Anthony says the decision to issue an apology for his interaction with a fan was made by Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan.

Anthony told a heckling fan Tuesday during the Knicks' loss to Portland to ask Dolan for his money back, pointing to the owner sitting nearby. On Wednesday, the Knicks sent a statement on Anthony's behalf in which he said he shouldn't have responded the way he did.

Anthony says he spoke to Dolan, who felt it would be best to apologize.

"It was Mr. Dolan's decision," Anthony says Thursday after practice.

Anthony adds that it was written in collaboration with the Knicks, saying: "We sat down and we talked about it. Everybody thought it would be a good idea to send out an apology."

A spokesman for Dolan declined to comment.

Anthony has been frustrated as the Knicks have lost 15 of 18. He missed a team charity bowling event Wednesday, with the Knicks saying he was excused for personal reasons.
