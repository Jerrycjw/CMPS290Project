â€” The Golden State Warriors, who set an NBA record with 73 regular-season wins in 2015-16, headline the list of 24 teams scheduled to compete in Samsung NBA Summer League 2016 from July 8-18 at the Thomas & Mack Center and Cox Pavilion on the University of Nevada Las Vegas campus.

Samsung NBA Summer League 2016 will feature a tournament-style schedule and culminate in a Championship Game for the fourth consecutive year. Last year, coach Becky Hammon and the San Antonio Spurs were crowned champions of the 11-day, 67-game event, which set records for NBA TV viewership, consumption of digital content on NBA.com and NBA Mobile, total attendance and single-day attendance.

This year's event will feature 11 playoff teams from the 2015-16 NBA season -- including three of the four Conference Finalists in the Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State and Toronto Raptors. Additionally, the Philadelphia 76ers, owners of the top overall selection in June's NBA Draft 2016 presented by State Farm, will appear at Samsung NBA Summer League alongside 11 other teams with Draft Lottery picks.

Samsung NBA Summer League has long served as the launch pad for future NBA stars. Two-time Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry of Golden State played in Las Vegas prior to his rookie season, as did the last two Kia NBA Rookies of the Year: Karl-Anthony Towns (2015-16 winner) and Andrew Wiggins (2014-15) of the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The Memphis Grizzlies, who last competed in Las Vegas in 2013, join 22 returning NBA teams and an NBA Development League Select team this year. Teams will compete in three preliminary games beginning on July 8 before being seeded in a tournament that leads to the Championship Game on July 18. Each team will play at least five games in Las Vegas.

Tickets for the Samsung NBA Summer League will go on sale May 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Fans can purchase tickets by visiting NBATickets.com.

A complete schedule of games and broadcast information will be released at a later date.

Samsung, the official mobile device, tablet and television partner of the NBA, WNBA and NBA D-League, is the title partner of NBA Summer League for the third consecutive year. Through this partnership, Samsung provides technology solutions which power the Summer League.
