â€” The Utah Jazz have extended coach Quin Snyder's contract.

The team announced a long-term extension Friday morning, but did not release other details of the deal.

The 2016-17 season would have been the third year of the initial three-year deal Snyder signed when he was hired. The team has gone 78-86 in two years under Snyder and narrowly missed the playoffs this season.

General manager Dennis Lindsey knew Snyder well from working with him in the Spurs organization, but the best reference came from Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. Snyder played at Duke and was an assistant coach there as well.

"He said I think you're getting Quin at the perfect time in his professional life," Lindsey said. "And you're going to get a really hungry, motivated, focused coach that has something to prove. Coach Krzyzewski was 100 percent accurate. ... We got a really hungry coach."

Snyder is considered one of the bright, young minds in the game with a knack for developing players. The Jazz allowed just 95.4 points per game the last two seasons, the second-fewest in the league despite a roster that was ravaged by injuries in 2015-16. Snyder kept the team in contention for a playoff spot without starting point guard Dante Exum for the entire season and with Rudy Gobert, Derrick Favors and Alec Burks all missing long stretches.

Lindsey said players want a coach who cares about their well-being, is honest and upfront and has a strong plan for success - and that Snyder checks all three boxes.

"I am very grateful for this gesture by the Miller family and the Utah Jazz and appreciative of their belief in me to continue to lead this team," Snyder said in a statement. "(My wife) Amy and I are fortunate to be a part of a franchise and family that cares deeply for our community, stays true to its values and is committed to winning.

"More than anything, it is confirmation of our collective commitment to building a championship team."

The Jazz had the youngest roster in the league last season, but won 15 more games than they did during the 2013-14 season, the final year under coach Ty Corbin. They controlled their own destiny in the Western Conference playoff race until the penultimate game of the season. Lindsey and Snyder have subscribed to a slow, deliberate rebuild philosophy and there are expectations to make the playoffs in 2017 with an expected $28 million in cap space.
