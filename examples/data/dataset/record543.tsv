â€” The Cavaliers set an NBA record by making 25 3-pointers in Game 2 against Atlanta on Wednesday night.

With Kyrie Irving's 3-pointer with 5:06 left in the third, the Cavs surpassed the previous postseason record of 21 set by the Golden State Warriors on April 24.

At that point, the Cavs had more 3-pointers than Atlanta had field goals.

Led by J.R. Smith's six 3-pointers, the Cavs went 18 of 27 in a dizzying first 24 minutes, opening a 38-point lead. Cleveland bettered the league mark for any half - regular or postseason - by making 18 3s in a half.

Cleveland made seven consecutive 3-pointers in the first quarter, when the Cavs opened a 15-point lead. The Cavs didn't slow their barrage in the second quarter, when they made 10 more 3s.

The Cavs spent the final few minutes chasing history and when reserve Dahntay Jones dropped the Cavs' 24th 3 with 2:24 left, it bettered the mark of 23 previously held by Orlando (2009) and Houston (2013). Mo Williams added another 3 for good measure.
