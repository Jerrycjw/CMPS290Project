Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin's chance of participating in the Rio Olympics hasn't been jeopardized by his injuries or his suspension for punching a team staff member.

USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Wednesday that he doesn't judge people based on poor decisions they may have made.

Griffin was suspended four games and docked five games' pay totaling $859,442 for his altercation with the team's assistant equipment manager at a Toronto restaurant on Jan. 23. The star forward is recovering from a broken hand. Griffin had been out since Dec. 26 with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon when the punch-out occurred.

Colangelo says the 12-member U.S. national team will be selected from June 26-28. The team will open a weeklong training camp in Las Vegas on July 17.
