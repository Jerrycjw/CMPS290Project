Pelicans forward Anthony Davis has not returned to the court for the second half of New Orleans' game against Portland on Friday night because of a left knee injury.

Davis scored 19 points in the first half and did not appear to be in significant pain, but at times appeared to have a slight limp and winced a couple times before being subbed out with 51 seconds left in the second quarter.

The Pelicans announced the injury during the third quarter and that Davis was doubtful to return to the game.

Ryan Anderson began the second half in Davis' usual power forward spot.

Davis, a three-time All-Star who turned 22 this month, entered the game averaging 24.4 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.1 blocks.
