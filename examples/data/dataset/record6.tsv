Los Angeles Lakers rookie Anthony Brown will be out for at least four weeks with a stress reaction in his right foot.

The Lakers announced the results of Brown's MRI exam on Saturday.

He is averaging 4.0 points and 2.4 rebounds in 29 games for the Lakers this season. The second-round pick has started 11 games.

He played sparingly in the first two months of the season before cracking the rotation in January. He was in only two games in February, but played at least 26 minutes in the Lakers' last four games.

Lou Williams also is out for Sunday's game against Golden State with a strained hamstring.

Kobe Bryant might sit out again with a sore right shoulder, and Jordan Clarkson could miss another game with a patellar strain.
