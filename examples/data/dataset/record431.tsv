The Los Angeles Lakers have decided not to pick up the option for the 2016-17 season on the contract for Head Coach Byron Scott, it was announced Sunday night.

"We would like to thank Byron for his hard work, dedication and loyalty over the last two years, but have decided it is in the best interest of the organization to make a change at this time," said General Manager Mitch Kupchak.

The search for a new head coach will begin immediately.
