Most of San Antonio's starters sat out the Spurs' meaningless regular-season finale at Dallas.

LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker were not in uniform Wednesday night with the Spurs set as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference when the playoffs start this weekend.

Manu Ginobili and David West also were sidelined.

Danny Green was the only regular starter in the lineup for San Antonio, which already has a franchise record in victories but started the night six games behind Golden State.

There's a chance the Spurs will see the Mavericks again in the first round if they beat Dallas and Memphis beats the Warriors, who are going for a record 73 victories.
