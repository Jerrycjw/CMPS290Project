The Cavaliers have signed guard Jordan McRae for the remainder of this season.

The team said Wednesday that they have signed McRae to a multi-year contract, but provided no further details on his deal. McRae has appeared in three games since he signed a 10-day contract on Feb. 28.

The 6-foot-6 McRae began the season in the NBA Development League, where he made 29l starts for Delaware, averaging 23.3 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists. Against Canton on Jan. 26, he scored a D-League record 61 points with 11 rebounds and seven assists.

McRae also had two 10-day stints with the Phoenix Suns this season, appearing in seven games. He averaged 5.3 points and 1.4 assists in 11.7 minutes.

He was originally selected by San Antonio in the 2014 draft. McRae played in Australia for a year before joining Delaware for the season's final 13 games.
