Bulls star Derrick Rose sat out Friday's game against Miami because of a strained left groin, while Dwyane Wade was in the Heat's lineup after a bruised right thigh put his status in question.

Wade suited up against Chicago after he was hurt in Wednesday's loss at Milwaukee.

The Bulls, meanwhile, were without their starting backcourt with Rose and Jimmy Butler (strained left knee) remaining sidelined.

Rose's groin started bothering him during Thursday's loss at San Antonio, and his plan "for right now" is to play Monday at Toronto.

Butler visited Dr. James Andrews on Thursday and worked out on Friday. The Bulls hope to have him back Monday.

Chicago had E'Twaun Moore starting at point guard and Justin Holiday at shooting guard on Friday.
