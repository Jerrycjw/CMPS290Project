â€” After losing the first two games in Cleveland, the Atlanta Hawks made a lineup change for Game 3 on Friday night against the Cavaliers.

Thabo Sefolosha is taking over as a starter on place of slumping Kyle Korver.

Korver has only 10 points in the series, so the Hawks decided to change things up. Sefolosha is a better defensive player, no small consideration after the Cavaliers set an NBA record with 25 3-pointers in a Game 2 blowout.

Given Korver's failure to find many open looks, the Hawks hope that coming off the bench will give him a boost. The long-range specialist has attempted only three shots beyond the arc, making one.
