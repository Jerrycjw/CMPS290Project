Indiana Pacers starting center Ian Mahinmi was limited to non-contact drills at practice Monday because of a lingering lower back injury.

Mahinmi has been listed as questionable for most of the playoff series against Toronto but has started all four games, with the series tied 2-2. On Saturday, Mahinmi scored a career-high 20 points and had 10 rebounds and five assists, which were both playoff career highs.

After practice, Mahinmi told reporters that he was feeling better and has been getting treatment on the back since the end of Game 4. Mahinmi also said he is getting accustomed to playing with the injury.

Game 5 is Tuesday night.
