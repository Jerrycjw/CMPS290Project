Washington's Alan Anderson was ejected from the Wizards' game against Portland on Tuesday night after he elbowed Gerald Henderson in the face.

The two players scuffled with 1:23 left in the first quarter and had to be separated by their teammates. After a review, Henderson was given a personal foul, and he and Anderson each got technical fouls. Anderson was ejected for the elbow.

The loss of Anderson was a blow to the Wizards, who were without guard Bradley Beal because of a sprained pelvis.

Anderson was averaging 9.2 points and 2.6 rebounds after missing the first 55 games of the season following left ankle surgery. The Wizards have been managing his minutes since his return.
