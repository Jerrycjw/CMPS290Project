The team announced the move Friday before its game against Sacramento. The 6-foot-5 Brown has averaged 3.3 points and 13.2 minutes in 63 career games with Philadelphia, Minnesota and Phoenix. He was signed to two 10-day contracts with the Suns this season and averaged 2.5 points and 7.6 minutes in eight games.

Brown was taken in the second round of the 2013 draft by Minnesota.
