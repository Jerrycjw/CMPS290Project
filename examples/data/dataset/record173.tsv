With Yahoo! Fantasy playoffs in full swing, here are four waiver-wire players who look ready to contribute this weekend:

Toney Douglas, New Orleans (24 percent owned)

The veteran point guard continues to rack up stats for the Pelicans with Norris Cole (back) sidelined. Over his last three games, Douglas is averaging 13.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 33.1 minutes of action. His field goal percentage (34.2 percent) is troublesome. But his combination of points, assists and rebounds is tough to find on the waiver wire so he is definitely worth a look if you're already losing the field goal percentage category. The Pelicans matchup with the Pacers on Thursday and the Raptors on Saturday.

Jon Leuer, Phoenix (17 percent owned)

The versatile big man has tallied two straight double-doubles since Tyson Chandler (back) went down with injury during Monday's game against Memphis. Over this two-game span, Leuer is averaging 17.5 points on 50.0 percent shooting, 13.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 36.6 minutes. He obviously won't stay at this dominant level for the rest of the season. But you should ride the wave for as long as Chandler is sidelined, which could be indefinitely as the Suns have little to play for over the last couple weeks. Phoenix matches up with Sacramento on Friday and Boston on Saturday.

Salah Mejri, Dallas (14 percent owned)

The Mavericks center has exploded onto the scene in Dallas over his last two games with averages of 13.5 points on 55.6 percent shooting, 13.0 rebounds, 3.5 blocks and 1.0 steals in 31.2 minutes. He should continue to see major minutes for as long as he plays at this high level, so scoop him up quick for his combination of points, rebounds and blocks. The Mavericks matchup with the Warriors on Friday and the Kings on Sunday.

Tim Hardaway Jr., Atlanta (9 percent owned)

The third-year guard has quietly carved out a solid role for himself in Atlanta. Over his last three games, Hardaway is averaging 16.7 points on 60.0 percent shooting, 3.7 3-pointers, 2.7 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 23.7 minutes. He is seventh in the league in 3-pointers over this span and should continue to receive plenty of minutes with the Hawks. Give him a look if you need to pad your 3-point category this weekend. The Hawks matchup with the Bucks on Friday and the Pistons on Saturday.
