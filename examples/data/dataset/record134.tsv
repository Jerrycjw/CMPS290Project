Mavericks forward Jeremy Evans is out for the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.

Evans was limited to 30 games, including two starts, and the 2012 slam dunk champion played sparingly after he was reported to be battling shoulder soreness in January.

The 28-year-old Evans averaged 2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds while playing 8 minutes per game. His career averages are 3.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.

Evans signed with the Mavericks in the offseason after spending his first five years with Utah, which drafted him late in the second round in 2010.
