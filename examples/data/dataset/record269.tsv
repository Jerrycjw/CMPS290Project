Pistons vs. Heat (8 ET, TNT)

Playoff Implications

The intensity levels should be high in this matchup of two teams in the thick of a crowded Eastern Conference playoff race. The Pistons enter tied with the Pacers for the No. 7 and 8 spots, two games ahead of No. 9 seed Chicago and four games ahead of No. 10 seed Washington. Meanwhile, the Heat are tied with the Hornets for the No. 5 and 6 seeds and hold a 3½-game lead over Detroit and Indiana. The No. 3 through 6 seeds (Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Charlotte) are separated by just a ½-game with five or six games left for each team. With so much at stake, this matchup between Detroit and Miami should feel like an early playoff game.

Revving Their Engines

The Pistons have surged to a 7-2 record over their last nine games, including a huge win over the No. 9 seed Bulls on Saturday. Despite their success, the Pistons have struggled on offense over their last four games with an average of 91.5 points on 39.2 percent shooting. Detroit won its last matchup against Miami thanks to a game-winning 3-pointer from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. It was the Pistons' second win of the season over the Heat, with one win at home and one on the road. Tonight they battle in Miami, a place where the Pistons have lost seven of their last nine games. Andre Drummond, who has 64 double-doubles in 2015-16, is one double-double shy of tying Isiah Thomas for the team record for most double-doubles in a season (1983-84).

Looking To Reignite

The Heat surged up the standings after the All-Star break, but have cooled down over the past month with a record of 7-6 since March 9. Over this 13-game span, Miami is allowing 105.8 points per game, which is 7.3 points higher than its opponent season average. Dwyane Wade missed two of the Heat's three-game road trip due to back and neck injuries suffered against the Lakers. In two matchups against the Pistons this season, Wade has only scored a total of 21 points, including a career-low, 2-point performance on 1-for-9 shooting against Detroit on November 25. Hassan Whiteside is one double-double short of passing Udonis Haslem's season record (21) for the most double-doubles of the bench in Heat franchise history.

Timberwolves vs. Warriors (10:30 ET, TNT and League Pass)

Going For 70

With a win tonight, the Golden State Warriors will join the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls as the only two teams in NBA history to reach 70 wins. The Warriors need to finish 4-1 over their final five games to reach 73 wins and break the Bulls' iconic record. Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who was a member of the 1995-96 Bulls, says Golden State is "not really pushing" for the record, but after coming so far you know the Warriors have 73 wins in their minds with less than two weeks left. A win tonight would mark the first time in Warriors franchise history they have swept the Timberwolves in back-to-back seasons.

Young Wolves

Minnesota has struggled again this season with a record of 25-52 entering tonight's action. Despite the poor record, the Timberwolves are one of the most fun teams to watch in the league thanks to young studs Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine. Towns, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, has been the brightest of these three future stars this season with averages of 18.2 points on 54.4 percent shooting, 10.5 rebounds and 1.7 blocks. He has 48 double-doubles on the season, which is good for fourth in the league behind superstars Andre Drummond, Russell Westbrook and John Wall. Tune in to see if the young Wolves can stun the Warriors at home and snap their seven-game losing streak against Golden State.

Chasing 400

Warriors Drain 1000th 3-Pointer of the Season Steph Curry pulls up and hits Golden State's 1000th three-pointer of the season.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the top two 3-point shooters in the league and have combined for 640 3-pointers this season. In comparison, the 1995-96 Bulls hit 544 3-pointers as a team during their historic run. Curry needs 22 3-pointers over his final five games to hit 400 3-pointers for the season, a number many never thought a player would reach. It would break the NBA's single-season 3-point record, which Curry set with 286 last season, by more than 100 3-pointers. Prior to Curry, the most any one player hit during a season was 269 by Ray Allen in 2005-06. Expect the reigning MVP to be firing from behind the arch tonight as he aims for yet another unbelievable milestone.
