Former Arizona star and NBA Rookie of the Year Damon Stoudamire has been hired as the new coach at Pacific.

Athletic director Ted Leland announced Wednesday that he had hired Stoudamire to fill the vacancy. Coach Ron Verlin was suspended by the school in December stemming from an investigation into academic misconduct. Pacific announced last month that Verlin would not return and Stoudamire replaces interim coach Mike Burns.

Stoudamire spent the past seven years as an assistant coach with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies and in college at Arizona and most recently Memphis. After a stellar four-year college career at Arizona, Stoudamire played 13 seasons in the NBA with Toronto, Portland, Memphis and San Antonio.
