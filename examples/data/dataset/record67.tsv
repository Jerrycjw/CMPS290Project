There's nothing a little motivation to you get going, right?

That seems to be the case with a certain 7-foot German, who after tumbling to his lowest standing on the OSPR, has rebounded in a big way.

The middle of the list, meanwhile, remains relatively unchanged, while two names return to the season-long chase and a fivesome is itching to make the cut.

Notes: Statistics are through games of March 10. Rankings are based on entire regular season with heavy emphasis on recent play.

Any player who turns 33 during the regular season can be added to the Old School Power Rankings

1. Pau Gasol (35), Chicago Bulls

Last week's rank: 1

Last week's stats: 3 games, 20.3 ppg, 15.3 rpg, 7.7 apg

Season stats: 17.1 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 4.0 apg

We're beginning to sound like a broken record when it comes to Mr. Do It All, who again filled the stat sheet with some impressive numbers. In addition to the above stats, Gasol also managed 3.0 blocks and has two triple-doubles in his last six games. But if we're going to nitpick, the 16 turnovers in three games is hard to overlook.

2. Dwyane Wade (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 2

Last week's stats: 3 games, 20.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 4.3 apg

Season stats: 19.3 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg

Despite shooting just 40 percent from the field last week, Wade has now gone nine straight games with at least 16 points. He's also managed 20 or more in three of the last four. Wade also got defensive last week, snatching seven steals. It's the first time since Jan. 26-31 he's gone three straight games with two or more steals.

3. Dirk Nowitzki (37), Dallas Mavericks

Last week's rank: 5

Last week's stats: 3 games, 25.7 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 1.3 apg

Season stats: 18.0 ppg, 6.6 apg, 1.7 apg

Take that, OSPR. After slipping all the way to No. 5, Nowitzki turned things around quickly with three impressive games in which he shot 55.6 from the field, 43.8 from beyond the arc (7-for-16) and 90.9 from the free-throw line (10-for-11). For good measure, Nowitzki secured his first double-digit rebound game since Feb. 26.

4. Jamal Crawford (35), Los Angeles Clippers

Last week's rank: 4

Last week's stats: 3 games, 12.0 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 13.9 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.1 apg

After a five-point outing last Saturday on 2-for-7 shooting, Crawford rebounded decently with two games of 15 or more points. But it was still a tough shooting week for Crawford, who went just 38.2 from the field and would have slipped a notch if Randolph hadn't missed a couple games with injury.

5. Zach Randolph (34), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: 3

Last week's stats: 2 games, 15.5 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 2.0 apg

Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 apg

Randolph, who missed two games with a sore knee, managed one solid performance in the two he did play, going for 25 and eight in a win over the Jazz. But he followed that up two nights later with six points (3-for-10 shooting) and eight rebounds. That showing ended a string of 14 consecutive games with double-figure scoring.

6. Joe Johnson (34), Miami Heat

Last week's rank: 6

Last week's stats: 3 games, 12.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.3 apg

Season stats: 11.9 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.9 apg

It was another uneventful week for Johnson, who didn't break loose offensively despite 53.6 FG% and 66.7 3PT%. That tends to happen when you take just 27 FGA in three games combined. In fact, Johnson has managed 10 or more FGA in just two of his last five. For the season, Johnson has taken 15 or more FGA in a game just eight times.

7. Tony Parker (33), San Antonio Spurs

Last week's rank: 7

Last week's stats: 3 games, 9.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 8.0 apg

Season stats: 12.4 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.2 apg

Parker kept his position on the strength of Thursday's 20-point, 12-assist showing, which was his first double-double since Dec. 16. Outside of that game, it was a forgettable week for Parker, who went for a combined eight points on 3-for-14 shooting in his other two games. At least he's gone for five or more assists in four straight.

8. Tyson Chandler (33), Phoenix Suns

Last week's rank: NA

Last week's stats: 4 games, 9.5 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 0.3 apg

Season stats: 6.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 0.9 apg

What happens when you get two double-doubles in four games on 59.3 shooting from the field? You get back on the list for the first time since Week 11. Heck, it might have been a perfect 4-for-4 had Chandler managed more than four FGA in two of those games.

9. Kobe Bryant (37), Los Angeles Lakers

Last week's rank: 9

Last week's stats: 2 games, 19.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg

Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 3.2 apg

Like Parker, Bryant maintained his spot on the list thanks to Thursday's 26-point performance (11-for-16 FGA, 3-for-4 on 3-pointers) against the Cavaliers. It was one of his stronger games all season, and his highest scoring output since going for 27 on Feb. 4 against the Pelicans (and he needed 24 shots that night).

10. Vince Carter (39), Memphis Grizzlies

Last week's rank: Just missed

Last week's stats: 4 games, 11.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.5 apg

Season stats: 5.7 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 0.8 apg

With the Grizzlies looking like a MASH unit these days, Carter's number is being called more often (24.2 minutes last week). He's answering the call, scoring 15 or more points (on just 18 combined FGA) in back-to-back games to go along with 47.1 (8-for-17) from beyond the arc. He also chipped in 1.8 steals for the week.
