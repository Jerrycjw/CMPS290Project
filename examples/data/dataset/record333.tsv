Cavaliers reserve guard Iman Shumpert will miss the final two games of the regular season after having his left knee drained.

One of the team's best defenders, Shumpert will undergo further treatment and rest over the next few days. The team said he expected to be ready for practice in preparation of the playoffs, which begin this weekend.

Shumpert, who averages 5.8 points and 24.4 minutes, has been dealing with injuries since he was acquired by the Cavs last season in a trade from New York. He missed the start of this season after tearing a wrist ligament.

Also, backup point guard Mo Williams will visit orthopedist Dr. James Andrews for further evaluation on his injured left knee. Williams has been slowed by the injury for several months and has made previous trips to see Andrews.

Williams was sent home from the team's recent road trip after experience more soreness.
