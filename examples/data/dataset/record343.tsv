The testy first-round series between regional rivals Oklahoma City and Dallas got a little testier.

Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and Mavericks center Salah Mejri were assessed double technicals in Game 4 on Saturday night over an incident in front of the Oklahoma City bench that started when Anthony Morrow refused to give the ball to Mejri after the Thunder threw it out of bounds.

Dallas guard J.J. Barea confronted Morrow, the Oklahoma City guard and former Maverick who then shoved Barea. Westbrook and Mejri ended up nose-to-nose in a shouting match before all the players were separated by coaches and officials.

The Thunder also were given a delay-of-game warning.

Players had to be separated twice in Game 3, and Dallas coach Rick Carlisle later complained about an elbow thrown by Kevin Durant on Mejri. The NBA gave the Oklahoma City star a technical Friday, the day after the game.
