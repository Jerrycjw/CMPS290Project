Houston Rockets forward Montrezl Harrell has been suspended five games without pay in the NBA Development League for pushing a referee to the floor during an altercation.

Also, Bakersfield forward Derek Cooke Jr. was suspended one game without pay for pushing Harrell during the skirmish in a game Saturday.

It happened right after Bakersfield completed a 119-115 victory over Rio Grande, where Harrell is on assignment from the Rockets. The National Basketball Referees Association had called for a multiple-game suspension, saying Harrell committed "deliberate assault and battery" against the referee.

Harrell is ineligible to be recalled by the Rockets until he has completed his D-League suspension, which he began serving Tuesday.
