Cavaliers forward Kevin Love won't play against Washington, part of Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue's plans to rest his starters.

Love will sit out Friday's game against the Wizards, who beat the Cavs on Sunday when LeBron James sat out. The Cavs, who lead the Eastern Conference by two games over Toronto heading into the weekend, will play three games in the next four days. They host Boston on Saturday night.

Lue wants to get his starters and rotational players some rest as the Cavs gear up for the playoffs and make a run at their second straight Finals.

Cleveland hasn't played since Monday, but Lue decided to extend the break for Love.

James is expected to sit out some upcoming games. As of Thursday, James said he and Lue had not yet outlined a strategy to get him some time off.
