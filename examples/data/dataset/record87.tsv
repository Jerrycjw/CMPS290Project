Memphis guard Mario Chalmers left the Grizzlies' 116-96 loss to the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night after injuring his right leg.

There did not appear to be any contact on the play midway through the third quarter. Chalmers needed help to leave the court, unable to put any weight on his right leg.

Chalmers was averaging 10.8 points and 3.8 assists for Memphis, mostly as a backup for Mike Conley. Conley has missed the last two games with a sore left foot.

The Grizzlies were also without center Marc Gasol, who will miss the rest of the season with a broken right foot, and Zach Randolph (sore right knee).
