The Milwaukee Bucks have lost guard O.J. Mayo for the rest of the season after he broke his right ankle Thursday morning going down a set of stairs at his home.

General manager John Hammond said Mayo fractured his ankle after he "accidentally tripped descending his stairs."

Mayo averaged 7.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.17 steals in 26.6 minutes during 41 games this season for the Bucks, who are last in the Central Division with a record of 27-38.
