Cavaliers starting guard point Kyrie Irving will miss Sunday's game against Charlotte with a sprained right ankle.

Irving injured his ankle late in the first half of Friday night's overtime win in Atlanta. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue does not know how long Irving, who missed the season's first 24 games while recovering from offseason knee surgery, will be sidelined.

Matthew Dellavedova will start in place of Irving, who averages 19.5 points and 4.6 assists.

Irving scored 20 points in the win over the Hawks, but went just 5 of 23 from the field.

The Cavs have a three-game lead over Toronto for the top seed in the Eastern Conference and Lue wants to get some of his starters some rest before the playoffs begin. LeBron James is in the lineup Sunday and Lue said he hasn't decided when he'll sit some key players.
