The Phoenix Suns are relocating their Development League team from Bakersfield, California, to Prescott Valley, Arizona.

In making the move, the Suns purchased the Bakersfield Jam, becoming the 15th NBA team to own and operate its D-League affiliate.

The team will be known as the Northern Arizona Suns and will play their 24-game home schedule at the 5,100-seat Prescott Valley Events Center beginning in the 2016-17 season.
