Grizzlies forward-center Brandan Wright is out indefinitely after an MRI exam found a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.

The Grizzlies announced the injury update Monday and said surgery is not required to repair his knee.

Wright left Saturday night's loss in Phoenix with 11:05 left in the third quarter. This was the same knee the 6-foot-10 Wright had surgery on in December after soreness had sidelined him since Nov. 7. Saturday's injury occurred in Wright's fifth game back after his rehab.

Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said the injury was an unfortunate development both for Memphis and Wright.

The forward-center is averaging 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds in 17.7 minutes over 12 games this season.

Memphis plays at Denver on Monday night.
