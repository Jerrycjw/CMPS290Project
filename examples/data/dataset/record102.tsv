The Memphis Grizzlies are down to just one healthy starter against the Cavaliers.

The team will be missing four starters, point guard Mike Conley, center Chris Andersen and forwards Zach Randolph and Matt Barnes, Monday night when they take on LeBron James and the Eastern Conference's top team.

The banged-up Grizzlies are already missing franchise center Marc Gasol.

The Grizzlies initially announced that both Conley (foot) and Andersen (shoulder) would sit. But then coach David Joerger said during his pregame availability about 90 minutes before the opening tip that Randolph (knee) and Barnes (hamstring) will also rest.

Joerger said Conley underwent an MRI and the team hopes to have more information on him and Andersen later this week.

"We'll look at them more at the end of the week," Joerger said. "They are going to be out for a while."

Joerger still hadn't decided who would start against the Cavs, who are 27-5 at home this season.

One positive for the Grizzlies is that guard Tony Allen is back after missing eight games with a sore left knee.

Conley is the club's playmaker, averaging 15.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and a team-high 6.1 assists in 56 starts this season. Andersen is averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds in 16 games for both Memphis and Miami.

Randolph averages 14.6 points and 7.9 rebounds, and Barnes averages 9.0 points and 5.1 rebounds.

Joerger said the Grizzlies hope to have an update by Friday on Conley and Andersen, who injured his shoulder in Sunday's loss at Phoenix. After playing Cleveland, Memphis visits Boston on Wednesday.

The Grizzlies have had a rash of major injuries this season. Gasol is done for the season with a broken right foot and forward Brandan Wright has been sidelined with a strained right knee.
