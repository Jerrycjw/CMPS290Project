The Golden State Warriors' stunning comeback win over the Oklahoma City Thunder is the most-watched non-Christmas NBA regular-season game since 2013.

The defending champions' 121-118 overtime victory Saturday night averaged more than 5.3 million viewers on ABC. ESPN said Tuesday that's the most since 5.4 million for the 2013-14 season opener between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls on TNT.

Saturday's broadcast drew nearly 8.1 million viewers during the overtime period.
