Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward will return Saturday night against the Chicago Bulls after missing the previous two games with plantar fasciitis of the right foot.

Hayward, who leads the Jazz in scoring with an average of 20.1 points, told the team he felt well enough to play following the morning shootaround.

Coach Quin Snyder said Hayward will not be under a minutes restriction.

"The nature of the injury is it's pain-related," Snyder said. "Rest and treatment is really the only thing that can improve it. We'll just take it day-by-day and see how he's doing."

The game against the Bulls is the start of a five-game trip for Utah, which enters with a four-game winning streak.

"Getting Gordon back is a boost going on this trip," Snyder said. "What you're able to sustain at home, as far as energy, is more difficult on the road."
