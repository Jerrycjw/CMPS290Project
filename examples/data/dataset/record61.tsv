Portland Trail Blazers reserve Ed Davis was ejected with 2:42 remaining in the third quarter of their game against the Orlando Magic for a flagrant foul on Jason Smith.

Davis used both arms to come down hard on Smith as he drove to the basket. Initially called a common foul, officials reviewed the play and upgraded it to a Flagrant 2, which is an automatic ejection. Replays showed Davis' forearm catching Smith across the nose without much of an attempt to play the ball.

Smith got into a verbal exchange earlier in the period with Portland star Damian Lillard. The two were quickly separated by officials.

Portland led 82-60 at the time of the ejection.
