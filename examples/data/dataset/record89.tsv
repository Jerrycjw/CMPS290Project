Spurs Sports & Entertainment today announced that Peter M. Holt has retired as the organization's Chairman and CEO and that Julianna Hawn Holt will assume both roles. Peter has held the position since 1996 when the Holts became the largest shareholder in San Antonio Spurs, LLC. Peter will remain on the organization's board of managers and continue as part of the ownership group while Julianna will become the team's Governor on the NBA's Board of Governors.

"I'm proud of what we've achieved over the last two decades," said Peter Holt. "The championships are wonderful, bringing new sports franchises to San Antonio is important but the biggest accomplishment for me will always be the impact we've had in our community. The pride, support and love that our city has for the Spurs is truly amazing."

Under the Holts' leadership, the team has become one of the premier franchises in North American sports. The Spurs have captured five NBA titles (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014) while qualifying for the playoffs 19 straight seasons. The 2015-16 Spurs have a 54-10 record, the best mark to start a season in franchise history, and are a perfect 30-0 at home, which is the third best home record to start a season in NBA history.

"Our ownership in the Spurs has always been a family affair," said Julianna Hawn Holt. "For many years I've had the desire to take a more active role with Spurs Sports & Entertainment. We felt this was the right time to make this transition. We are very excited about the current Spurs season and the future of the organization."

Spurs Sports & Entertainment owns five sports franchises, the San Antonio Spurs, the San Antonio Rampage (AHL), the San Antonio Stars (WNBA), San Antonio FC (USL) and the Austin Spurs (NBA Development League). In addition, SS&E manages the day-to-day operations of the AT&T Center and Toyota Field. Under the Holts' watch, the organization has grown to over 350 full-time and almost 1,000 part-time employees.

"We've been fortunate to have a wonderful ownership group for the last two decades," said Rick Pych, president of business operations for SS&E. "Peter has provided great leadership. His dedication, vision and management style have allowed all of us to develop, grow and succeed. We thank him for his service to the Spurs and the San Antonio community. All of us are excited about the future of SS&E under the guidance and leadership of Julianna."

The board of managers of San Antonio Spurs, LLC, per the request of Julianna, has appointed Pych as co-CEO.
