News about Sports player is always a big topic of sports fans. There are lots of knowledge base which cover each domain's player information, however, there is no such a knowledge base that cover every domain of sports. Here we want to choose a subset domain of it, which is NBA player's knowledge base, and try to implement a generic way to extract knowledge from the internet which can extend to all other sports domains.

We choose a subset topics from players' knowledge base, which is player's injury history. Comparing with common information for a sports player, the information of injury history is not well documented or transfer to structured files. However, it is a hot topic for every sports fan, especially for those people who want to buy a ticket to watch a game, the first thing to do is to check whether the best player got an injury. Here we present a method to build a player injury knowledge base from crawled sports news. Even though we are focusing on NBA players, but we think it has a good reference for further study on all sports player injury history knowledge base. The tool we are using for this problem is DDLite, which is a light weight version of DeepDive but powerful framework for prototyping \& developing structured information extraction applications. Beyond the relation extracted from news, we capture additional information like date and keyword from news to give a better description.
